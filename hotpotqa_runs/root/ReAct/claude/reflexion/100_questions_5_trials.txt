Clinton ran as the Democratic Party's candidate for president, in which she became the first woman to win a presidential nomination by a major U.S. political party. Prior to running, Clinton served as the United States secretary of state in the administration of Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013, a U.S. senator representing New York from 2001 to 2009, and the first lady of the United States, as the wife of Bill Clinton, from 1993 to 2001. She was defeated in the general election by the Republican candidate, businessman Donald Trump.Clinton announced her candidacy on April 12, 2015. Her main competitor in the Democratic primaries was Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran as a more progressive candidate in the primary. Clinton became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party on June 6, 2016, having received the required number of delegates. On July 22, she announced Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate, and the two were formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 26.Clinton received the most support from middle aged and older voters, as well as from African-American, Latino, and older female voters. She focused her platform on several issues, including expanding racial, LGBTQ, and women's rights; raising wages and ensuring equal pay for women; and improving healthcare. Clinton lost the general election to Republican Donald Trump on November 9, 2016; she conceded the following day. Clinton's narrow, unprecedented losses in the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin were considered key to her defeat. These states all had swings from voters who had previously voted for Obama yet went for Trump in 2016. These states have largely rely on manufacturing and part Trump’s campaign appeal was that he would end international trade agreements that hurt American manufacturing. He was outspoken on trade issues.[1]  Had Clinton been elected, she would have been the first female and first spouse of a president to serve as president of the United States, whereas her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, would also have been the first acting first lady since Margaret Woodrow Wilson.

Question: The W. H. Shipman House is in what Hawaii county?
Thought 1: Search[W. H. Shipman House]
Action 1: Search[W. H. Shipman House]
Observation 1: W. H. Shipman House is a historic home used by William Herbert Shipman.  It is located at 141 Kaʻiulani Street, named for Princess Kaʻiulani, the last crown princess of the Kingdom and Liliʻuokalani's niece.In 1856 King Kamehameha IV leased an area known as Kolo iki to William Reed for cattle pasture. In 1861 Reed purchased the 26 acres (11 ha) and it came to be known as "Reed's Island". It is not really an island, but the area between a current and ancient channel of the Wailuku River.J. R. "Jack" Wilson owned Volcano Stables, a horse rental business at the current site of the historic Volcano Block Building in Hilo. In 1899 after an iron bridge was completed, Wilson bought a 8-acre (3.2 ha) lot with a view on Reed's island and built a large house in the Victorian architecture style. It was designed by Honolulu architect Henry Livingston Kerr, and constructed with indoor plumbing and electricity. In addition to the main house placed prominently on a hill the estate includes a guest house, servants' quarters, gardens, and a garage. An unusual feature is the two-story round tower with conical roof, circular veranda, and large curved panes of glass.In February 1901 William Shipman bought the house to entertain guests in the growing city of Hilo.Deposed Queen Liliʻuokalani would play her compositions at the grand piano when she was visiting.Author Jack London and his wife stayed at this house for five weeks in August and September 1907, while his boat The Snark was being repaired. London's book The Cruise of the Snark (1911) is based on this journey. In the early 1930s, Cecil B. DeMille filmed Four Frightened People in the gulch below the house, as well as on the Shipman land in Puna. In 1939 artist Georgia O'Keeffe stayed and was shown various sites that appeared in her paintings.The Hilo house was listed on the state register of historic places on December 5, 1973, as site 10-35-7405, and the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on June 23, 1978, as site 78001013.Barbara-Ann Andersen (daughter of Roy Shipman Blackshear, a great-granddaughter of W. H. Shipman) restored the house and operated it for roughly 20 years starting in 1997 as a bed and breakfast hotel.

Observation 1: Nicolae Titulescu (Romanian pronunciation: [nikoˈla.e tituˈlesku]; 4 March 1882 – 17 March 1941) was a Romanian politician and diplomat, at various times ambassador, finance minister, and foreign minister, and for two terms served as president of the General Assembly of the League of Nations (1930–32).
Thought 2: Search[League of Nations]
Action 2: Search[League of Nations]
Observation 2: The League of Nations (LN or LoN; French: Société des Nations [sɔsjete de nɑsjɔ̃], SdN) was the first worldwide intergovernmental organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. It was founded on 10 January 1920 by the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War. The main organisation ceased operations on 18 April 1946 when many of its components were relocated into the new United Nations (UN) which was created in the aftermath of the Second World War.The League's primary goals were stated in its eponymous Covenant. They included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Its other concerns included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe. The Covenant of the League of Nations was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, and it became effective with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920. Australia was granted the right to participate as an autonomous member nation, marking the start of Australian independence on the global stage. The first meeting of the Council of the League took place on 16 January 1920, and the first meeting of the Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920. In 1919, U.S. president Woodrow Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role as the leading architect of the League. Despite this, he was ultimately unsuccessful in getting his country to join it.The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious Allied Powers of World War I (Britain, France, Italy and Japan were the initial permanent members of the Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement medical tents, Benito Mussolini responded that "the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out."At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. After some notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. Its credibility was weakened because the United States never joined. Japan and Germany left in 1933, Italy left in 1937, and Spain left in 1939. The Soviet Union only joined in 1934 and was expelled in 1939 after invading Finland. Furthermore, the League demonstrated an irresolute approach to sanction enforcement for fear it might only spark further conflict, further decreasing its credibility. One example of this hesitancy was the Abyssinia Crisis, in which Italy's sanctions were only limited from the outset (coal and oil were not restricted), and later altogether abandoned despite Italy being declared the aggressors in the conflict. The onset of the Second World War in 1939 showed that the League had failed its primary purpose: to prevent another world war. It was largely inactive until its abolition. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations effectively replaced it in 1945, inheriting several agencies and organisations founded by the League, with the League itself formally dissolving the following year.Current scholarly consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its main goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, gave a voice to smaller nations; fostered economic stabilisation and financial stability, especially in Central Europe in the 1920s; helped to raise awareness of problems such as epidemics, slavery, child labour, colonial tyranny, refugee crises and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation. Professor David Kennedy portrays the League as a unique moment when international affairs were "institutionalised", as opposed to the pre–First World War methods of law and politics.

Observation 1: Otterington railway station was located in the village of South Otterington, North Yorkshire, on the East Coast Main Line. It opened in 1841 and closed in 1958. The station is now a private residence, though the platform can still be seen.

Action 2: Search[East Coast Main Line]
Observation 2: The East Coast Main Line (ECML) is a 393-mile-long (632 km) electrified railway between its northern terminus at Edinburgh Waverley and southern terminus at London King's Cross.  Peterborough, Doncaster, York, Darlington, Durham and Newcastle are on the line, which is a key transport artery on the eastern side of Great Britain running broadly parallel to the A1 road. The main line acts as a 'spine' for several diverging branches, serving destinations such as Cambridge, Leeds, Hull, Sunderland and Lincoln, all with direct services to London. In addition, a few ECML services extend beyond Edinburgh to serve other Scottish destinations, such as Stirling, Inverness, Dundee, or Aberdeen.The line was built during the 1840s by three railway companies, the North British Railway, the North Eastern Railway, and the Great Northern Railway. In 1923, the Railways Act 1921 led to their amalgamation to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the line became its primary route. The LNER competed with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) for long-distance passenger traffic between London and Scotland. The LNER's chief mechanical engineer Nigel Gresley designed iconic Pacific steam locomotives including Flying Scotsman and Mallard, the latter of which achieved a world record speed for a steam locomotive, 126 mph (203 km/h) on the Grantham-to-Peterborough section on 3 July 1938.In 1948, the railways were nationalised and operated by British Railways. In the early 1960s, steam was replaced by diesel-electric traction, including the Deltics, and sections of the line were upgraded so that trains could run at speeds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h). With the demand for higher speed, British Rail introduced InterCity 125 high-speed trains between 1976 and 1981. In 1973, a Class 41 (an HST prototype) achieved a top speed of 143 mph (230 km/h) in a test run. In the 1980s, the line was electrified and InterCity 225 trains introduced. These have in turn been largely replaced by Class 800 and Class 801 units. The November 2021 Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands stated that the linespeed would be upgraded to 140 mph (225 km/h).The line links London, South East England, East Anglia and the East Midlands, with Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland, and is important to their local economies. It carries commuter traffic in north London as well as cross-country, commuter and local passenger services, and freight. In 1997, operations were privatised. The primary long-distance operator is London North Eastern Railway, but open-access competition on services to Northern England and Scotland is provided by Hull Trains, Grand Central and Lumo.
Thought 3: Based on the information provided, the Otterington railway station was located on the East Coast Main Line, which is a 393-mile railway line that links Edinburgh to London King's Cross. Therefore, the city that the East Coast Main Line linked Edinburgh to is London.

Observation 2: Clara Ann Fowler (November 8, 1927 – January 1, 2013), better known by her stage name Patti Page, was an American singer. Primarily known for pop and country music, she was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six-decade-long career. She was often introduced as "the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page". New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as "A Page in my life called Patti".Page signed with Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948's "Confess". In 1950, she had her first million-selling single "With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming", and eventually had 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965.Page's signature song, "Tennessee Waltz", is the best selling song of the 1950s by a female artist, one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is recognized today as one of the official songs of the state of Tennessee.

Page had three additional number-one hit singles between 1950 and 1953, "All My Love (Bolero)", "I Went to Your Wedding", and "(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?".Unlike most other pop singers, Page blended country music styles into many of her songs. As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page's singles appeared on the Billboard Country Chart. In the 1970s, she shifted her style more toward country music and began having even more success on the country charts, ending up as one of the few vocalists to have charted in five separate decades.With the rise of rock and roll in the 1950s, mainstream popular music record sales began to decline. Page was among the few pop singers who were able to maintain popularity, continuing to have hits well into the 1960s, with "Old Cape Cod", "Allegheny Moon", "A Poor Man's Roses (or a Rich Man's Gold)", and "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte".In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. She was posthumously honored with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2013.

His most notable film is Cannibal Holocaust, considered one of the most controversial and brutal in the history of cinema, which was seized, banned or heavily censored in many countries, and which contained special effects so realistic that they led to Deodato being arrested on suspicion of murder. Cannibal Holocaust is also cited as a precursor of found footage films such as The Blair Witch Project and The Last Broadcast. The film strengthened Deodato's fame as an "extreme" director and earned him the nickname "Monsieur Cannibal" in France.Deodato was an influence on film directors like Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth and Nicolas Winding Refn.

Incorporating themes from multiple genres, including dark fantasy, science fantasy, horror, and Western, it describes a "gunslinger" and his quest toward a tower, the nature of which is both physical and metaphorical. The series, and its use of the Dark Tower, expands upon Stephen King's multiverse and in doing so, links together many of his other novels.In addition to the eight novels of the series proper that comprise 4,250 pages, many of King's other books relate to the story, introducing concepts and characters that come into play as the series progresses.The series was chiefly inspired by the poem "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came" by Robert Browning, the full text of which was included in the final volume's appendix. In the preface to the revised 2003 edition of The Gunslinger, King also identifies The Lord of the Rings, Arthurian legend, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as inspirations. He identifies Clint Eastwood's "Man with No Name" character as one of the major inspirations for the protagonist, Roland Deschain. King's style of location names in the series, such as Mid-World, and his development of a unique language (High Speech), are also influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien's work.A film based on Stephen King's novel series was released in August 2017.

Question: Where was the first governor after the The Missouri Compromise from?
Thought 1: Search[The Missouri Compromise]
Action 1: Search[The Missouri Compromise]
Observation 1: The Missouri Compromise (also known as the Compromise of 1820) was federal legislation of the United States that balanced the desires of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it. It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. While the slave states earlier claimed Federal protection for slavery, they now objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and claimed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana Purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. "[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality." "The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states."When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise provision that banned slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was controversial.  While it mollified most people at the time and settled the issue for more than 20 years, many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along regional and sectarian lines.  Tensions resumed in the 1840s and the Compromise of 1850 only briefly defused the situation. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.

Lollipop Chainsaw was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in June 2012. The game’s reception was divided. Japanese critics praised the games’ combo centered gameplay and the satirical storyline, while Western critics felt that the game’s repetitious gameplay and crude storyline were detracting factors. Nonetheless, the game garnered a cult following and was a commercial success, selling over 1.24 million units by June 2024.A remaster titled Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S in September 2024, with versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One released in December 2024.

Question: This expansion of the 2008 magazine article "Is Google Making Us Stoopid?" was a finalist for what award?
Thought 1: Search[Is Google Making Us Stoopid?]
Action 1: Search[Is Google Making Us Stoopid?]
Observation 1: Is Google Making Us Stupid? What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains! (alternatively Is Google Making Us Stoopid?) is a magazine article by technology writer Nicholas G. Carr, and is highly critical of the Internet's effect on cognition. It was published in the July/August 2008 edition of The Atlantic magazine as a six-page cover story. Carr's main argument is that the Internet might have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation. Despite the title, the article is not specifically targeted at Google, but more at the cognitive impact of the Internet and World Wide Web. Carr expanded his argument in The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains, a book published by W. W. Norton in June 2010.The essay was extensively discussed in the media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.While long-term psychological and neurological studies have yet to yield definitive results justifying Carr's argument, a few studies have provided glimpses into the changing cognitive habits of Internet users. A UCLA study led some to wonder whether a breadth of brain activity—which was shown to occur while users performed Internet searches in the study's functional MRI scans—actually facilitated reading and cognition or possibly overburdened the mind; and what quality of thought could be determined by the additional presence of brain activity in regions known to control decision-making and complex reasoning skills.

Question: What year did The Chronicle of Philanthropy's publishing overlap with Antic?
Thought 1: Search[The Chronicle of Philanthropy]
Action 1: Search[The Chronicle of Philanthropy]
Observation 1: The Chronicle of Philanthropy is a magazine and digital platform that covers the nonprofit world of philanthropy. Based in Washington, D.C., it is aimed at charity leaders, foundation executives, fund raisers, and other people involved in philanthropy. The Chronicle of Philanthropy publishes 12 print issues a year as well as daily Web coverage and multiple e-newsletters, including Philanthropy Today.The Chronicle of Philanthropy was founded in 1988 by editor Phil Semas and then managing editor Stacy Palmer. It was initially owned by The Chronicle of Higher Education Inc., which also publishes The Chronicle of Higher Education, a weekly newspaper covering colleges and universities. On May 4, 2022, The Chronicle of Philanthropy announced plans to spin off and become an independent, nonprofit organization, As of February 2023, with approval from the Internal Revenue Service, that transition took effect.
Thought 2: To find the year The Chronicle of Philanthropy's publishing overlapped with Antic, I will need to search for information on Antic as well.
Action 2: Search[Antic]
Observation 2: An attic (sometimes referred to as a loft) is a space found directly below the pitched roof of a house or other building. It is also known as a sky parlor or a garret. Because they fill the space between the ceiling of a building's top floor and its slanted roof, attics are known for being awkwardly-shaped spaces with difficult-to-reach corners and often exposed rafters.While some attics are converted into bedrooms, home offices, or attic apartments complete with windows and staircases, most remain difficult to access, and are usually entered using a loft hatch and ladder. Attics help control temperatures in a house by providing a large mass of slowly moving air, and are often used for storage. The hot air rising from the lower floors of a building is often retained in attics, further compounding their reputation as inhospitable environments. However, in recent years, they have been insulated to help decrease heating costs, since uninsulated attics account for 15% of the energy loss in average houses.A loft  or mezzanine is also the uppermost space in a building, but is distinguished from an attic in that an attic typically constitutes an entire floor of the building, while a loft or mezzanine covers only a few rooms, leaving one or more sides open to the lower floor.Attics are found in many different shapes and sizes. They also have many uses: In residential buildings, they are either small unusable spaces filled with insulation, or spaces with storage or HVAC equipment. Some commercial buildings also have attics under pitched roofs that are usually used for storage, mechanical equipment, or for roof access.
Thought 3: I apologize, but I do not have enough information to determine the year that The Chronicle of Philanthropy's publishing overlapped with Antic. The search results provided information about The Chronicle of Philanthropy and Antic, but did not mention any overlap in their publishing years. To answer this question, I would need to find more specific information about the publishing timelines of these two publications.

Observation 1: During World War II, Operation Cold Comfort was a failed SAS raid that began with a parachute drop north of Verona on 17 February 1945. It was later renamed Zombie. The 12 man ski team under Capt. Littlejohn, and their equipment were widely scattered in the drop, and thereafter found themselves among hostile locals of essentially German origin. Their mission was to block by landslide the main rail lines through the Brenner Pass, thus having a dramatic effect on German reinforcements moving south.The men spent most of their time in hiding and attempts to supply and reinforce by air were unsuccessful. Capt. Littlejohn and Corporal Crowley were captured and executed under Hitler’s Commando Order. Eventually on 31 March the situation had worsened to the point exfiltration was ordered.

Action 2: Search[special forces unit founded in what year]
Observation 2: The Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, commonly known as the Special Operations Forces (abbr.  SOF; Russian: Силы специальных операций; ССО, romanized: Sily spetsial’nykh operatsiy; SSO), are strategic-level special forces under the Special Operations Forces Command (Russian: Командование сил специальных операций, KCCO, romanized: Komandovaniye sil spetsial'nykh operatsiy, abbr. KSSO or KSO) of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. It is also a structural branch and an independent unit of the Armed Forces.The first units of what would become the Special Operations Forces were transferred from the GRU in 2009 as part of the continuing 2008 Russian military reform. The Special Operations Forces Command was established in 2012 and announced in March 2013 by the Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov. According to Gerasimov, the SOF was designed as a strategic-level asset, elite special operations force units of the KSSO whose primary missions would be foreign interventions including counter-proliferation, foreign internal defense operations and undertaking the most complex special operations and clandestine missions for protecting interests of the Russian Federation.The SOF is distinct from the Spetsnaz GRU with their use of soldiers hired on contract; or, to put it simply, mercenaries. All soldiers of the SOF are personnel who serve on contract; many of which all are full-time servicemen consisting of commissioned officers and regular soldiers.On 26 February 2015, President Vladimir Putin decreed that 27 February be the Day of the SOF, according to multiple Russian official news agencies (albeit not acknowledged formally), to mark the establishment of Russian control over the building of the Supreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in Simferopol, Crimea on 28 February 2014.
Thought 3: The information provided does not indicate the year the special forces unit involved in Operation Cold Comfort was founded. The passage discusses the Russian Special Operations Forces, but Operation Cold Comfort was a World War II operation, so it was likely carried out by a different special forces unit. Without more specific information about the unit involved in Operation Cold Comfort, I cannot determine the year it was founded.

Question: This term about a playwright who lived from 1564-1616 presented what about his works? 
Thought 1: Search[playwright 1564-1616]
Action 1: Search[William Shakespeare]
Observation 1: William Shakespeare (c. 23 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" or simply "the Bard". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner ("sharer") of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men after the ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 (around 1613) he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and even certain fringe theories as to whether the works attributed to him were written by others.Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in English. In the last phase of his life he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) such as The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, and collaborated with other playwrights.Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623 John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its preface includes a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, who hailed Shakespeare with the now-famous epithet: "not of an age, but for all time".

Observation 2: Shape (stylized in all caps) is an American monthly fitness magazine started by Weider Publications in 1981, founded by Christine MacIntyre (a pioneer in women's free weight fitness) and became the number one women's fitness magazine. At that time, Weider Enterprises consisted primarily of the bodybuilding magazine Muscle & Fitness. Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present Shape, Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine. Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy. MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided. Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1987. Weider was purchased by American Media in 2002. A German version of Shape is available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The magazine is also edited in Romania.Elizabeth Goodman Artis was named Editor-in-Chief in 2014 and held the position until 2021.On January 28, 2015, it was reported that Shape would be acquired by Meredith Corp. and Fitness, published by the company, would cease publication in May 2015 and be combined with it.

Action 1: Search[Ernest Hemingway]
Observation 1: Ernest Miller Hemingway ( HEM-ing-way; July 21, 1899 – July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short-story writer and journalist. Known for an economical, understated style that influenced later 20th-century writers, he has been romanticized for his adventurous lifestyle and outspoken, blunt public image. Some of his seven novels, six short-story collections and two non-fiction works have become classics of American literature, and he was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature.Hemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. After high school, he spent six months as a reporter for The Kansas City Star before enlisting in the Red Cross. He served as an ambulance driver on the Italian Front in World War I and was seriously wounded by shrapnel in 1918. In 1921, Hemingway moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star and was influenced by the modernist writers and artists of the "Lost Generation" expatriate community. His debut novel, The Sun Also Rises, was published in 1926. In 1928, Hemingway returned to the U.S., where he settled in Key West, Florida. His experiences during the war supplied material for his 1929 novel A Farewell to Arms.In 1937, Hemingway went to Spain to cover the Spanish Civil War, which formed the basis for his 1940 novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, written in Havana, Cuba. During World War II, Hemingway was present with Allied troops as a journalist at the Normandy landings and the liberation of Paris. In 1952, his novel The Old Man and the Sea was published to considerable acclaim, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. On a 1954 trip to Africa, Hemingway was seriously injured in two successive plane crashes, leaving him in pain and ill health for much of the rest of his life. He died of suicide at his house in Ketchum, Idaho, in 1961.

Question: Beer Wars covers the differences between large corporate breweries, and small breweries, such as what brewery that is headquartered in Escondido, california?
Thought 1: Search[Beer Wars]
Action 1: Search[Beer Wars]
Observation 1: Beer Wars is a 2009 documentary film about the American beer industry. In particular, it covers the differences between large corporate breweries, namely Anheuser-Busch, the Miller Brewing Company, and the Coors Brewing Company opposed to smaller breweries like Dogfish Head Brewery, Moonshot 69, Yuengling, Stone Brewing Co., and other producers of craft beer. Also covered is how advertising and lobbyists are used to control the beer market, implying that these things harm competition and consumer choice.Throughout the film, there is a theme that the smallest breweries have next to no chance to compete due to the sheer volume of advertising and outdated beer distribution laws. The original laws demanded a three-tier system to separate the powers of selling beer. The law demands that the beer brewer cannot deliver directly to the retailer, supposedly creating a separation of powers resembling the US government's legislative, judicial, and executive branches. The film claims these laws are now inhibiting growth of smaller brewers and therefore allowing the largest brewers (Coors, Anheuser-Busch, and Miller) to maintain an oligopoly on beer.The film was written, produced, narrated, and directed by Anat Baron, former head of Mike's Hard Lemonade.

The company's best known brand is Arrogant Bastard Ale, which has been described as a "watershed beer" that "put San Diego on the craft brew map." Most of Stone's beers are characteristic of west-coast craft beer, meaning that they have a high hop content, and an average alcohol strength between 6% and 10%.Stone Brewing has been rated as a "world class brewery" by two beer enthusiast websites, RateBeer and BeerAdvocate. Stone Brewing has been voted by the readers of Beer Advocate as the #1 "All Time Top Brewery on Planet Earth."In August 2022, Sapporo Breweries bought Stone for $165 million, with the Stone brewery taking on production of Sapporo beers in California for distribution across North America.

Observation 2: Joe Frazier vs. Muhammad Ali, billed as The Fight of the Century or simply The Fight, was an undisputed heavyweight championship boxing match between WBA, WBC, and The Ring heavyweight champion Joe Frazier and Lineal champion  Muhammad Ali, on Monday, March 8, 1971, at Madison Square Garden in New York City.The fight is widely regarded as the biggest boxing match in history and arguably the single most anticipated and publicized sporting event of all time. An international audience observed the spectacle. It was the first time that two undefeated boxers who held or had held the world heavyweight title fought each other for that very title.The bout held broad appeal for many Americans, including non-boxing and non-sport fans. Ali, who had been stripped of his titles by boxing authorities for refusing to submit to the draft for the Vietnam War, had become a symbol of the anti-establishment public during his government-imposed exile from the ring. In contrast, Frazier supported U.S. involvement in the war, and he had been adopted by elements of the public with alternate views. In addition, both men possessed intense personal animosity towards each other.Frazier won in fifteen rounds by unanimous decision. Ali dealt with his first professional loss. It became the first of a trio of fights, followed by the rematch events Super Fight II (1974) and the Thrilla in Manila (1975). Both of those fights were won by Ali.

Action 1: Search[Clayton Kershaw]
Observation 1: Clayton Edward Kershaw (born March 19, 1988), nicknamed "Kersh", is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), all for the Los Angeles Dodgers. A left-handed starting pitcher, Kershaw was a two-time World Series champion, an 11-time National League (NL) All-Star, three-time Cy Young Award winner, 2014 NL Most Valuable Player. He is one of 20 pitchers, and four left-handers, to be members of the 3,000 strikeout club. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history.Kershaw was drafted by the Dodgers with the seventh overall pick in the first round of the 2006 MLB draft. He worked his way through the Dodgers' farm system and reached the majors at age 20 after one season. In 2011, he won the pitching Triple Crown and the NL Cy Young Award, becoming the youngest pitcher to accomplish either of these feats since Dwight Gooden in 1985. Kershaw pitched a no-hitter on June 18, 2014.He was the first major league pitcher to lead MLB in ERA in four consecutive years (2011–2014) and also led the NL in a fifth. Kershaw is also a three-time NL wins leader and strikeouts leader. His 2.53 career earned run average (ERA) is the lowest among starters in the live-ball era (min. 1,000 innings pitched).

He and his wife Ellen launched "Kershaw's Challenge" and wrote the book Arise: Live Out Your Faith and Dreams on Whatever Field You Find Yourself to raise money to build an orphanage in Zambia.

Question: Which other film did one of the supporting cast in "Sleepless in Seattle" appear?

Action 1: Search[Sleepless in Seattle cast]
Observation 1: Sleepless in Seattle is a 1993 American romantic comedy film directed by Nora Ephron, from a screenplay written by Jeff Arch, David S. Ward and Ephron. Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the film follows a journalist (Ryan) who becomes enamored with a widowed architect (Hanks) when his son calls in to a talk radio program requesting a new wife for his grieving father. In addition to Bill Pullman, Ross Malinger, and Rob Reiner, the film also features Rosie O'Donnell, Gaby Hoffmann, Victor Garber, Rita Wilson, Barbara Garrick, and Carey Lowell.Inspired by director Leo McCarey's An Affair to Remember (1957), which was a same-script remake of McCarey's Love Affair (1939), Sleepless in Seattle was conceived as a romantic drama by Jeff Arch in 1989. Several studios rejected his script, deterred by the idea that its main couple does not meet for nearly the entire film. Ward and Ephron were hired for script revisions, with Ephron tapped to direct. Although both Hanks and Ryan had been favored for the lead roles from the beginning, several other actors expressed interest in both parts. The film was shot mostly in Seattle during the summer of 1992. Several of its most pivotal scenes were filmed on a former naval base due to the city's lack of sound stages, including a recreation of the Empire State Building's observation deck when the New York skyscraper was not available.Sleepless in Seattle was released on June 25, 1993, to positive reviews, receiving praise for Ephron's writing and direction, as well as Hanks and Ryan's performances. The film received 2 nominations at the 66th Academy Awards: Best Original Screenplay and Best Original Song. Despite competition from several blockbusters released around that same summer, the film was a surprise commercial success, earning $17 million during its opening weekend (the highest opening for a romantic comedy at the time), and ultimately grossing over $227.9 million worldwide. It was one of the highest-grossing films of 1993, and remains one of the most successful romantic comedies in box-office history. Its success extended to the home video market: it was the top rental of 1994 in the United States. The soundtrack was also successful, peaking at number one on the Billboard 200.Several critics and media publications agree that Sleepless in Seattle is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time. The film is also credited with establishing Ephron as a celebrated romantic comedy filmmaker.

Observation 2: (Result 1/1) ==== Retrospective ====Retrospective reviews have remained mostly positive. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 75% out of 60 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.6/10. The consensus states, "Sleepless in Seattle is a cute classic with a very light touch and real chemistry between the two leads – even when spending an entire movie apart." According to the same website, Sleepless in Seattle is their 146th highest-rated romantic comedy of all-time (out of 200), warning readers that they might find the film's relatively low placement surprising considering its popularity. Rotten Tomatoes also ranked Sleepless in Seattle the 53rd best blockbuster of the 1990s decade. On Metacritic, the film has a 72 out of 100 rating, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".Caroline Siede of The A.V. Club praised both the lead and supporting cast's performances; the father-son dynamic between Hanks and Malinger's characters during both comedic and heartfelt moments. Praising the performances of Hanks, Ryan, O'Donnell and Reiner, as well as the film's humor, The Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw said Ephron "brought her terrific flair, wit and nous, although she propagates the terrifying fallacy that a widower makes a wonderful romantic catch". Virginia Florey of the Midland Daily News said the film "still do[es] a fantastic job of pulling you into their story and their search to find that one person to love". While declaring that Sleepless in Seattle remains the best romantic comedy ever released, Body+Soul contributor Hannah-Rose Yee said despite being "the kind of movie that gives romantic comedies a bad name ... no film has come close to distilling what Sleepless in Seattle does about the ridiculous enterprise that is opening up your heart to someone else". However, she admitted that one's ability to enjoy the film depends "entirely on how on board you can get with a romance in which the two lead characters don't meet until the last five minutes". The Guardian's Luke Walpole, who had avoided watching the film until 2020 in fear that it had aged poorly, ultimately found Ephron's screenplay to be a gorgeous "balance of melancholy and fizzing optimism", but criticized Sleepless in Seattle's "narrowly middle class and privileged" characters. Common Sense Media wrote that the film is successful in Ephron's hands, despite its "frustrating" structure at times.Siede noted that in recent years, Annie's actions in pursuit of Sam have been re-evaluated as what some critics perceive as stalker behavior, with Nicole Sperling of Vanity Fair feeling Annie's determination "verges into stalker territory". Siede defended the character, writing "Annie's 'romantic' stalking falls well within the purview of creepy real-world behavior we're somehow willing to forgive in a heightened rom-com context. And plenty of beloved rom-com leading men have pulled stunts just as creepy". R. Eric Thomas of Elle noted that "in terms of rom-com hijinks and poor decisions that turn out great, nothing beats [Annie's behavior] in Sleepless in Seattle", but relented that the film remains "a jewel". Thomas also found Wilson's An Affair to Remember monologue to be deserving of an Academy Award, and one of the film's best scenes. Guy Lodge of The Guardian commended Ryan for helping "her character's wildly irrational whimsy ... make sympathetic sense". Upon re-watching the film in 2016, Bustle's S. Atkinson perceived Annie as "a woman who is pretty damn morally dubious with regards to her relationship to her fiancée", explaining that "I'd gone from completely doting on the two leads when watching it first time round as a kid to finding them the absolute worst watching again an adult".

His comics are noted for their blending of the real and the surreal. Largely autobiographical, Kochalka's cartoon expression of the world around him includes such real-life characters as his wife, children, cat, friends and colleagues, but always filtered through his own observations and flights of whimsy. In March 2011 he was declared the cartoonist laureate of Vermont, serving a term of three years.

Action 2: Search[Bigfoot]
Observation 2: Bigfoot (), also commonly referred to as Sasquatch (), is a large, hairy mythical creature said to inhabit forests in North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Bigfoot is featured in both American and Canadian folklore, and since the mid-20th century has become a cultural icon, permeating popular culture and becoming the subject of its own distinct subculture.Enthusiasts of Bigfoot, such as those within the pseudoscience of cryptozoology, have offered various forms of dubious evidence to support Bigfoot's existence, including anecdotal claims of sightings as well as supposed photographs, video and audio recordings, hair samples, and casts of large footprints. However, the evidence is a combination of folklore, misidentification and hoax, and the creature is not a living animal.Folklorists trace the phenomenon of Bigfoot to a combination of factors and sources, including the European wild man figure, folk tales, and indigenous cultures. Examples of similar folk tales of wild, hair-covered humanoids exist throughout the world, such as the Skunk ape of the southeastern United States, the Almas, Yeren, and Yeti in Asia, the Australian Yowie, and creatures in the mythologies of indigenous people. Wishful thinking, a cultural increase in environmental concerns, and overall societal awareness of the subject have been cited as additional factors.

Thought 2: Search[Russia-United Kingdom relations 20th century]
Action 2: Search[Russia-United Kingdom relations 20th century]
Observation 2: Russia–United Kingdom relations, also Anglo-Russian relations, are the bilateral relations between the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Formal ties between the nations started in 1553. Russia and Britain became allies against Napoleon in the early-19th century. They were enemies in the Crimean War of the 1850s, and rivals in the Great Game for control of Central Asia in the latter half of the 19th century. They allied again in World Wars I and II, although the Russian Revolution of 1917 strained relations. The two countries again became enemies during the Cold War (1947–1989). Russia's business tycoons developed strong ties with London financial institutions in the 1990s after the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, relations became very tense after the United Kingdom imposed sanctions against Russia. It was subsequently added to Russia's list of "unfriendly countries".The two countries share a history of intense espionage activity against each other, with the Soviet Union succeeding in penetration of top echelons of the British intelligence and security establishment in the 1930s–1950s while concurrently, the British co-opted top Russian intelligence officers throughout the period including the 1990s whereby British spies such as Sergei Skripal acting within the Russian intelligence establishment passed on extensive details of their intelligence agents operating throughout Europe. Since the 19th century, England has been a popular destination for Russian political exiles, refugees, and wealthy fugitives from the Russian-speaking world.In the early-21st century, especially following the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, relations became strained. In the early years of David Cameron as UK prime minister, there was a brief uptick in relations, up until 2014. Since 2014, relations have grown increasingly unfriendly due to the Russo-Ukrainian War (2014–present) and the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in 2018. In the wake of the poisoning, 28 countries expelled suspected Russian spies acting as diplomats. In June 2021, a confrontation occurred between HMS Defender and the Russian Armed Forces in the 2021 Black Sea incident.Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, relations between the two nuclear powers collapsed entirely; the United Kingdom imposed economic sanctions on Russian outlets, seized the assets of Russian oligarchs, recalled its citizens and severed all business ties with Russia. Russia retaliated with its own sanctions against the UK and accused it of involvement in attacks against Sevastopol Naval Base, the Nord Stream gas pipeline and the Crimean Bridge. The UK is one of the largest donors of financial and military aid to Ukraine and was the first country in Europe to donate lethal military aid.
Thought 3: Based on the information provided, it seems the Russia-United Kingdom relations were in a state of rivalry after the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II during World War I. The passage mentions that Russia and Britain were allies against Napoleon in the early-19th century, but then became enemies in the Crimean War of the 1850s and rivals in the "Great Game" for control of Central Asia in the latter half of the 19th century. It also states that the Russian Revolution of 1917 (which occurred after the abdication of Nicholas II) strained relations between the two countries. So the war during which their relations were in a state of rivalry after Nicholas II's abdication appears to be World War I.

Observation 1: The Battle of White Plains took place during the New York and New Jersey campaign of the American Revolutionary War on October 28, 1776, near White Plains, New York. Following the retreat of George Washington's Continental Army northward from New York City, British General William Howe landed troops in Westchester County, intending to cut off Washington's escape route. Alerted to this move, Washington retreated farther, establishing a position in the village of White Plains but failing to establish firm control over local high ground. Howe's troops drove Washington's troops from a mountain near the village; following this loss, Washington ordered the Americans to retreat farther north.Later British movements chased Washington across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania. Washington then crossed the Delaware and surprised a brigade of Hessian troops in the December 26 Battle of Trenton.

Question: Where was the original line of the railroad William Howard worked for?
Thought 1: Search[William Howard railroad]
Action 1: Search[William Howard railroad]
Observation 1: William Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 – March 8, 1930) was the 27th president of the United States from 1909 to 1913 and the tenth chief justice of the United States from 1921 to 1930. He is the only person to have held both offices.Taft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. His father, Alphonso Taft, was a U.S. attorney general and secretary of war. Taft attended Yale and joined Skull and Bones, of which his father was a founding member. After becoming a lawyer, Taft was appointed a judge while still in his twenties. He continued a rapid rise, being named solicitor general and a judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1901, President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and he became Roosevelt's hand-picked successor. Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice, Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, believing his political work to be more important.With Roosevelt's help, Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency in that November's election. As president, he focused on East Asia more than European affairs and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments. Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs, then a major source of governmental income, but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests. His administration was filled with conflict between the Republican Party's conservative wing, with which Taft often sympathized, and its progressive wing, toward which Roosevelt moved more and more. Controversies over conservation and antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men. The 1912 presidential election was a three-way race, as Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination. Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates and Roosevelt bolted the party. The split left Taft with little chance of reelection, and he took only Utah and Vermont in his loss to Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson.After leaving office, Taft returned to Yale as a professor, continuing his political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft chief justice, an office he had long sought. Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues, and under him there were advances in individual rights. In poor health, he resigned in February 1930, and died the following month. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there. Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.
Thought 2: The query is asking about where the original line of the railroad that William Howard worked for was located, but the information provided in the search results is about William Howard Taft, the 27th president of the United States. There is no mention of William Howard or any railroad he may have worked for. To answer this question, I would need to find information specifically about a person named William Howard and the railroad he was associated with.

Thought 1: Search[Jessica Jones]
Action 1: Search[Jessica Jones]
Observation 1: Jessica Campbell Jones-Cage, professionally known as Jessica Jones, is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Michael Gaydos and first appeared in Alias #1 (November 2001) as part of Marvel's Max, an imprint for more mature content, and was later retroactively established to have first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #4 (June 1963) in the Silver Age of Comic Books as an unnamed classmate of Peter Parker, created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. Within the context of Marvel's shared universe, Jones is a former superhero who becomes the owner (and usually sole employee) of Alias Private Investigations. Bendis envisioned the series as centered on the private investigator superhero Jessica Drew, designing and characterising Jones as a reinvention of Drew returning to her P.I. origins, only deciding to make her a new P.I. character once he realized that the main character he was writing had a distinct-enough voice and background to differentiate her from Drew, though deciding to still name the character Jessica (after Drew) on the basis of how "two [people] can have the same first name".Jones has since starred in three ongoing series: Alias, The Pulse, and Jessica Jones. Alias ran for 28 issues before ending in 2004, while The Pulse ran for 14 issues from April 2004 to May 2006. Jessica Jones debuted in October 2016, initially published as a tie-in with the self-titled television series. She became a member of the New Avengers, alongside her husband Luke Cage during Marvel's 2010 Heroic Age campaign. After the events of Devil's Reign in which Cage became the Mayor of New York City, Jones is now the first lady of New York City. She has used various aliases throughout her history, including Jewel, Knightress, Mrs. Cage, and Power Woman. Jessica Jones has been described as one of Marvel's most powerful female heroes.Krysten Ritter portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) streaming television series Jessica Jones (2015-2019) and The Defenders (2017); she is set to reprise her role in the second season of Daredevil: Born Again (2026). Elizabeth Cappuccino portrays a young Jessica in the first and second seasons of Jessica Jones. Tara Strong voices the character in the video games Lego Marvel's Avengers, Marvel Heroes, and Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order, while Michelle Phan voices a Vietnamese American version of the character in the video game Marvel Avengers Academy.

The series began with Mary Poppins in 1934.The books centre on the magical English nanny Mary Poppins, who is blown by the East wind to Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, London, and into the Banks household to care for their children. Encounters with pavement-painters and shopkeepers, and various adventures ensue, until Mary Poppins abruptly leaves, i.e., "pops out". Only the first three of the eight books feature Mary Poppins arriving and leaving. The later five books recount previously unrecorded adventures from her original three visits.

Main areas of conflict included Europe and the Middle East, as well as parts of Africa and the Asia-Pacific. The war saw important developments in weaponry including tanks, aircraft, artillery, machine guns, and chemical weapons. One of the deadliest conflicts in history, it resulted in an estimated 30 million military casualties, and 8 million civilian deaths from war-related causes and genocide. The movement of large numbers of people was a major factor in the deadly Spanish flu pandemic.The causes of World War I included the rise of the German Empire and decline of the Ottoman Empire, which disturbed the long-standing balance of power in Europe, the exacerbation of imperial rivalries, and an arms race between the great powers. Growing tensions in the Balkans reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914 when Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb, assassinated Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia, and declared war on 28 July. After Russia mobilised in Serbia's defence, Germany declared war on Russia and France, who had an alliance. The United Kingdom entered the war after Germany invaded Belgium, and the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in November. Germany's strategy in 1914 was to quickly defeat France before transferring its forces to the east, but its advance was halted in September, and by the end of the year the Western Front consisted of a near-continuous line of trenches from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more dynamic, but neither side gained a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives. Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and others entered the war from 1915 onward.Major battles, including those at Verdun, the Somme, and Passchendaele, failed to break the stalemate on the Western Front. In April 1917, the United States joined the Allies after Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare against Atlantic shipping. Later that year, the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in the October Revolution; Soviet Russia signed an armistice with the Central Powers in December, followed by a separate peace in March 1918. That month, Germany launched a spring offensive in the west, which despite initial successes left the German Army exhausted and demoralised. The Allied Hundred Days Offensive, beginning in August 1918, caused a collapse of the German front line. Following the Vardar Offensive, Bulgaria signed an armistice in late September. By early November, the Allies had signed armistices with the Ottomans and with Austria-Hungary, leaving Germany isolated. Facing a revolution at home, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated on 9 November, and the war ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918.The Paris Peace Conference of 1919–1920 imposed settlements on the defeated powers. Under the Treaty of Versailles, Germany lost significant territories, was disarmed, and was required to pay large war reparations to the Allies. The dissolution of the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman empires led to new national boundaries and the creation of new independent states including Poland, Finland, the Baltic states, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The League of Nations was established to maintain world peace, but its failure to manage instability during the interwar period contributed to the outbreak of World War II in 1939.
Thought 3: Based on the information provided, the Livesey Hal War Memorial does not appear to be related to World War II, which had over 60 million casualties. The passage discusses World War I, which had an estimated 30 million military casualties and 8 million civilian deaths. Since the question asks about the war commemorated by the Livesey Hal War Memorial, and the passage does not mention this memorial, I do not have enough information to determine which war it commemorates.

Observation 1: The Oneida Community ( oh-NYE-də) was a perfectionist religious communal society founded by John Humphrey Noyes and his followers in 1848 near Oneida, New York. The community believed that Jesus had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about Jesus's millennial kingdom themselves, and be perfect and free of sin in this world, not just in Heaven (a belief called perfectionism). The Oneida Community practiced communalism (in the sense of communal property and possessions), group marriage, male sexual continence, Oneida stirpiculture (a form of eugenics), and mutual criticism.The community's original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878. There were smaller Noyesian communities in Wallingford, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; Putney and Cambridge, Vermont. The branches were closed in 1854 except for the Wallingford branch, which operated until the 1878 tornado devastated it.The Oneida Community dissolved in 1881, converting itself to a joint-stock company. This eventually became the silverware company Oneida Limited, one of the largest in the world.

The proclamation confirms by name the identity of the new monarch, expresses loyalty to the "lawful and rightful Liege Lord", and formally announces the new monarch's regnal name, while the council witnesses the signing and sealing of several documents concerning the accession. The privy council (a subset of the accession council) is then called into the presence of the monarch to hear the monarch's address and the witness monarch's signing and sealing of documents. An Accession Council has confirmed every English (and later, British) monarch since James I in 1603.

Clinton ran as the Democratic Party's candidate for president, in which she became the first woman to win a presidential nomination by a major U.S. political party. Prior to running, Clinton served as the United States secretary of state in the administration of Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013, a U.S. senator representing New York from 2001 to 2009, and the first lady of the United States, as the wife of Bill Clinton, from 1993 to 2001. She was defeated in the general election by the Republican candidate, businessman Donald Trump.Clinton announced her candidacy on April 12, 2015. Her main competitor in the Democratic primaries was Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran as a more progressive candidate in the primary. Clinton became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party on June 6, 2016, having received the required number of delegates. On July 22, she announced Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate, and the two were formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 26.Clinton received the most support from middle aged and older voters, as well as from African-American, Latino, and older female voters. She focused her platform on several issues, including expanding racial, LGBTQ, and women's rights; raising wages and ensuring equal pay for women; and improving healthcare. Clinton lost the general election to Republican Donald Trump on November 9, 2016; she conceded the following day. Clinton's narrow, unprecedented losses in the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin were considered key to her defeat. These states all had swings from voters who had previously voted for Obama yet went for Trump in 2016. These states have largely rely on manufacturing and part Trump’s campaign appeal was that he would end international trade agreements that hurt American manufacturing. He was outspoken on trade issues.[1]  Had Clinton been elected, she would have been the first female and first spouse of a president to serve as president of the United States, whereas her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, would also have been the first acting first lady since Margaret Woodrow Wilson.

Observation 1: W. H. Shipman House is a historic home used by William Herbert Shipman.  It is located at 141 Kaʻiulani Street, named for Princess Kaʻiulani, the last crown princess of the Kingdom and Liliʻuokalani's niece.In 1856 King Kamehameha IV leased an area known as Kolo iki to William Reed for cattle pasture. In 1861 Reed purchased the 26 acres (11 ha) and it came to be known as "Reed's Island". It is not really an island, but the area between a current and ancient channel of the Wailuku River.J. R. "Jack" Wilson owned Volcano Stables, a horse rental business at the current site of the historic Volcano Block Building in Hilo. In 1899 after an iron bridge was completed, Wilson bought a 8-acre (3.2 ha) lot with a view on Reed's island and built a large house in the Victorian architecture style. It was designed by Honolulu architect Henry Livingston Kerr, and constructed with indoor plumbing and electricity. In addition to the main house placed prominently on a hill the estate includes a guest house, servants' quarters, gardens, and a garage. An unusual feature is the two-story round tower with conical roof, circular veranda, and large curved panes of glass.In February 1901 William Shipman bought the house to entertain guests in the growing city of Hilo.Deposed Queen Liliʻuokalani would play her compositions at the grand piano when she was visiting.Author Jack London and his wife stayed at this house for five weeks in August and September 1907, while his boat The Snark was being repaired. London's book The Cruise of the Snark (1911) is based on this journey. In the early 1930s, Cecil B. DeMille filmed Four Frightened People in the gulch below the house, as well as on the Shipman land in Puna. In 1939 artist Georgia O'Keeffe stayed and was shown various sites that appeared in her paintings.The Hilo house was listed on the state register of historic places on December 5, 1973, as site 10-35-7405, and the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on June 23, 1978, as site 78001013.Barbara-Ann Andersen (daughter of Roy Shipman Blackshear, a great-granddaughter of W. H. Shipman) restored the house and operated it for roughly 20 years starting in 1997 as a bed and breakfast hotel.

Thought 2: Search[League of Nations]
Action 2: Search[League of Nations]
Observation 2: The League of Nations (LN or LoN; French: Société des Nations [sɔsjete de nɑsjɔ̃], SdN) was the first worldwide intergovernmental organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. It was founded on 10 January 1920 by the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War. The main organisation ceased operations on 18 April 1946 when many of its components were relocated into the new United Nations (UN) which was created in the aftermath of the Second World War.The League's primary goals were stated in its eponymous Covenant. They included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Its other concerns included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe. The Covenant of the League of Nations was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, and it became effective with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920. Australia was granted the right to participate as an autonomous member nation, marking the start of Australian independence on the global stage. The first meeting of the Council of the League took place on 16 January 1920, and the first meeting of the Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920. In 1919, U.S. president Woodrow Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role as the leading architect of the League. Despite this, he was ultimately unsuccessful in getting his country to join it.The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious Allied Powers of World War I (Britain, France, Italy and Japan were the initial permanent members of the Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement medical tents, Benito Mussolini responded that "the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out."At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. After some notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. Its credibility was weakened because the United States never joined. Japan and Germany left in 1933, Italy left in 1937, and Spain left in 1939. The Soviet Union only joined in 1934 and was expelled in 1939 after invading Finland. Furthermore, the League demonstrated an irresolute approach to sanction enforcement for fear it might only spark further conflict, further decreasing its credibility. One example of this hesitancy was the Abyssinia Crisis, in which Italy's sanctions were only limited from the outset (coal and oil were not restricted), and later altogether abandoned despite Italy being declared the aggressors in the conflict. The onset of the Second World War in 1939 showed that the League had failed its primary purpose: to prevent another world war. It was largely inactive until its abolition. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations effectively replaced it in 1945, inheriting several agencies and organisations founded by the League, with the League itself formally dissolving the following year.Current scholarly consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its main goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, gave a voice to smaller nations; fostered economic stabilisation and financial stability, especially in Central Europe in the 1920s; helped to raise awareness of problems such as epidemics, slavery, child labour, colonial tyranny, refugee crises and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation. Professor David Kennedy portrays the League as a unique moment when international affairs were "institutionalised", as opposed to the pre–First World War methods of law and politics.

Observation 1: Otterington railway station was located in the village of South Otterington, North Yorkshire, on the East Coast Main Line. It opened in 1841 and closed in 1958. The station is now a private residence, though the platform can still be seen. The buildings date from the 1930s when the East Coast Main Line was widened.The station became a listed building in 2018.

Action 2: Search[East Coast Main Line]
Observation 2: The East Coast Main Line (ECML) is a 393-mile-long (632 km) electrified railway between its northern terminus at Edinburgh Waverley and southern terminus at London King's Cross.  Peterborough, Doncaster, York, Darlington, Durham and Newcastle are on the line, which is a key transport artery on the eastern side of Great Britain running broadly parallel to the A1 road. The main line acts as a 'spine' for several diverging branches, serving destinations such as Cambridge, Leeds, Hull, Sunderland and Lincoln, all with direct services to London. In addition, a few ECML services extend beyond Edinburgh to serve other Scottish destinations, such as Stirling, Inverness, Dundee, or Aberdeen.The line was built during the 1840s by three railway companies, the North British Railway, the North Eastern Railway, and the Great Northern Railway. In 1923, the Railways Act 1921 led to their amalgamation to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the line became its primary route. The LNER competed with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) for long-distance passenger traffic between London and Scotland. The LNER's chief mechanical engineer Nigel Gresley designed iconic Pacific steam locomotives including Flying Scotsman and Mallard, the latter of which achieved a world record speed for a steam locomotive, 126 mph (203 km/h) on the Grantham-to-Peterborough section on 3 July 1938.In 1948, the railways were nationalised and operated by British Railways. In the early 1960s, steam was replaced by diesel-electric traction, including the Deltics, and sections of the line were upgraded so that trains could run at speeds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h). With the demand for higher speed, British Rail introduced InterCity 125 high-speed trains between 1976 and 1981. In 1973, a Class 41 (an HST prototype) achieved a top speed of 143 mph (230 km/h) in a test run. In the 1980s, the line was electrified and InterCity 225 trains introduced. These have in turn been largely replaced by Class 800 and Class 801 units.

Primarily known for pop and country music, she was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six-decade-long career. She was often introduced as "the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page". New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as "A Page in my life called Patti".Page signed with Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948's "Confess". In 1950, she had her first million-selling single "With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming", and eventually had 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965.Page's signature song, "Tennessee Waltz", is the best selling song of the 1950s by a female artist, one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is recognized today as one of the official songs of the state of Tennessee.

As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page's singles appeared on the Billboard Country Chart. In the 1970s, she shifted her style more toward country music and began having even more success on the country charts, ending up as one of the few vocalists to have charted in five separate decades.With the rise of rock and roll in the 1950s, mainstream popular music record sales began to decline. Page was among the few pop singers who were able to maintain popularity, continuing to have hits well into the 1960s, with "Old Cape Cod", "Allegheny Moon", "A Poor Man's Roses (or a Rich Man's Gold)", and "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte".In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.

Observation 2: The New York and New Jersey campaign in 1776 and the winter months of 1777 was a series of American Revolutionary War battles for control of the Port of New York and the state of New Jersey, fought between British forces under General Sir William Howe and the Continental Army under General George Washington.  Howe was successful in driving Washington out of New York, but overextended his reach into New Jersey, and ended the New York and New Jersey campaign in January 1777 with only a few outposts near New York City under British control. The British held New York Harbor for the rest of the Revolutionary War, using it as a base for expeditions against other targets.Landing unopposed on Staten Island on July 3, 1776, Howe had assembled an army that included components that had withdrawn from Boston in March following the British failure to hold that city, combined with additional British troops, and Hessian troops hired from several German principalities. Washington's Continental Army included New England soldiers and regiments from the Thirteen Colonies as far south as the Colony of Virginia. Landing on Long Island in August, Howe defeated Washington in the largest battle of the war in North America, but the Continental Army was able to regroup and make an orderly and covert retreat to Manhattan that night under a cover of darkness and fog. Washington suffered a series of further defeats in Manhattan but prevailed in a skirmish at the Battle of Harlem Heights and eventually withdrew his troops successfully to White Plains, New York. Howe, meanwhile, returned to Manhattan and captured those forces Washington had left on the island.Washington and much of his army crossed the Hudson River to Rockland County and then south into New Jersey, retreated across the state, and then crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. Along the way, his army shrank due to the ending of enlistment periods, desertions, and poor morale. Howe ordered his troops into winter quarters in December, establishing a chain of outposts from New York City to Burlington, New Jersey.  Washington, in a tremendous boost to American morale, launched a successful strike against the Trenton garrison on the morning of December 26, 1776, prompting Howe to withdraw his chain of outposts back to New Brunswick and the coast near New York. Washington, in turn, established his winter camp at Morristown.  During the following winter months and through the rest of the war, both sides skirmished frequently around New York City and New Jersey as the British sought forage and provisions.Britain maintained control of New York City and some of the surrounding territory until the war ended in 1783, using it as a base for operations elsewhere in North America.  In 1777, General Howe launched a campaign to capture the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia, leaving General Sir Henry Clinton in command of the New York area, while General John Burgoyne led an attempt to gain control of the Hudson River valley, moving south from Quebec and being defeated at Saratoga.

Observation 2: The Dark Tower is a series of eight novels, one novella, and a children's book written by American author Stephen King. Incorporating themes from multiple genres, including dark fantasy, science fantasy, horror, and Western, it describes a "gunslinger" and his quest toward a tower, the nature of which is both physical and metaphorical. The series, and its use of the Dark Tower, expands upon Stephen King's multiverse and in doing so, links together many of his other novels.In addition to the eight novels of the series proper that comprise 4,250 pages, many of King's other books relate to the story, introducing concepts and characters that come into play as the series progresses.The series was chiefly inspired by the poem "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came" by Robert Browning, the full text of which was included in the final volume's appendix. In the preface to the revised 2003 edition of The Gunslinger, King also identifies The Lord of the Rings, Arthurian legend, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as inspirations. He identifies Clint Eastwood's "Man with No Name" character as one of the major inspirations for the protagonist, Roland Deschain. King's style of location names in the series, such as Mid-World, and his development of a unique language (High Speech), are also influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien's work.A film based on Stephen King's novel series was released in August 2017.

Let me diagnose the possible reason for the failure and devise a new, concise, high-level plan to mitigate the same failure.Possible reason for failure:In the previous trial, I was able to find information about the Oneida Community, which was a religious Utopian group. However, I did not find the connection that this group later became the giant silverware company Oneida Limited, which was run by Pierrepont Noyes. I focused too much on the Oneida Community itself and did not make the necessary link to the silverware company.New plan:1. Search for information on the Oneida Community and its connection to the silverware company.2. Specifically look for information on Pierrepont Noyes and his role in running the silverware company.3. Synthesize the information to provide a concise answer to the original question.

Action 1: Search[Oneida Community]
Observation 1: The Oneida Community ( oh-NYE-də) was a perfectionist religious communal society founded by John Humphrey Noyes and his followers in 1848 near Oneida, New York. The community believed that Jesus had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about Jesus's millennial kingdom themselves, and be perfect and free of sin in this world, not just in Heaven (a belief called perfectionism). The Oneida Community practiced communalism (in the sense of communal property and possessions), group marriage, male sexual continence, Oneida stirpiculture (a form of eugenics), and mutual criticism.The community's original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878. There were smaller Noyesian communities in Wallingford, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; Putney and Cambridge, Vermont. The branches were closed in 1854 except for the Wallingford branch, which operated until the 1878 tornado devastated it.The Oneida Community dissolved in 1881, converting itself to a joint-stock company. This eventually became the silverware company Oneida Limited, one of the largest in the world.

In the first trial, I should have searched for each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols and looked up details on their deaths, rather than just focusing on Mussolini. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the exact title of the 2004 film, when I should have tried searching for similar film titles from that year. And in the third trial, I could not find any information about VIVA Media AG changing its name in 2004, likely because the query was too specific and the information was not readily available.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will take a more systematic approach to researching the information needed to answer the questions. Rather than jumping straight to a final answer, I will:1. Thoroughly search for and gather all relevant information about the key entities and events mentioned in the question.2. Carefully review and synthesize the information collected to identify the most likely answer.3.

To answer this question, I would need to find more specific information about VIVA Media AG and any name changes or rebranding they underwent in 2004.

Question: Where was the first governor after the The Missouri Compromise from?
Thought 1: Search[Missouri after the Missouri Compromise]
Action 1: Search[Missouri after the Missouri Compromise]
Observation 1: The Missouri Compromise (also known as the Compromise of 1820) was federal legislation of the United States that balanced the desires of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it. It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. While the slave states earlier claimed Federal protection for slavery, they now objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and claimed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana Purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. "[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality." "The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states."When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise provision that banned slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was controversial.  While it mollified most people at the time and settled the issue for more than 20 years, many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along regional and sectarian lines.  Tensions resumed in the 1840s and the Compromise of 1850 only briefly defused the situation. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.

Action 1: Search[Rome Protocols]
Observation 1: The Rome Protocols (German: Römer Protokolle, Hungarian: Római jegyzőkönyvek) were a series of three international agreements concluded in Rome on 17 March 1934 between the governments of Austria, Hungary, and Italy. They were signed by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, and Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös. All of the protocols went into effect on 12 July 1934 and were registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 December 1934.

Action 2: Search[Assassination of Engelbert Dollfuss]
Observation 2: Engelbert Dollfuss (alternatively Dollfuß; 4 October 1892 – 25 July 1934) was an Austrian politician and dictator who served as chancellor of Austria between 1932 and 1934. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative and nationalist government. This crisis culminated in the self-elimination of the Austrian Parliament, a coup sparked by the resignation of the presiding officers of the National Council. Suppressing the Socialist movement in the Austrian Civil War and later banning the Austrian Nazi Party, he cemented his rule through the First of May Constitution in 1934. Later that year, Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitler's Anschluss in 1938.

Here is my diagnosis and a new plan:Diagnosis: The key issue in the previous trial was that the passage did not contain any information about the expansion of the 2008 magazine article "Is Google Making Us Stoopid?" being a finalist for an award. The passage focused on providing background information on the original article and the subsequent book, but did not mention anything about awards related to the article's expansion.New Plan:

Question: This expansion of the 2008 magazine article "Is Google Making Us Stoopid?" was a finalist for what award?
Thought 1: Search[Is Google Making Us Stoopid?]
Action 1: Search[Is Google Making Us Stoopid?]
Observation 1: Is Google Making Us Stupid? What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains! (alternatively Is Google Making Us Stoopid?) is a magazine article by technology writer Nicholas G. Carr, and is highly critical of the Internet's effect on cognition. It was published in the July/August 2008 edition of The Atlantic magazine as a six-page cover story. Carr's main argument is that the Internet might have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation. Despite the title, the article is not specifically targeted at Google, but more at the cognitive impact of the Internet and World Wide Web. Carr expanded his argument in The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains, a book published by W. W. Norton in June 2010.The essay was extensively discussed in the media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.While long-term psychological and neurological studies have yet to yield definitive results justifying Carr's argument, a few studies have provided glimpses into the changing cognitive habits of Internet users. A UCLA study led some to wonder whether a breadth of brain activity—which was shown to occur while users performed Internet searches in the study's functional MRI scans—actually facilitated reading and cognition or possibly overburdened the mind; and what quality of thought could be determined by the additional presence of brain activity in regions known to control decision-making and complex reasoning skills.

Thought 2: Search[Antic]
Action 2: Search[Antic]
Observation 2: An attic (sometimes referred to as a loft) is a space found directly below the pitched roof of a house or other building. It is also known as a sky parlor or a garret. Because they fill the space between the ceiling of a building's top floor and its slanted roof, attics are known for being awkwardly-shaped spaces with difficult-to-reach corners and often exposed rafters.While some attics are converted into bedrooms, home offices, or attic apartments complete with windows and staircases, most remain difficult to access, and are usually entered using a loft hatch and ladder. Attics help control temperatures in a house by providing a large mass of slowly moving air, and are often used for storage. The hot air rising from the lower floors of a building is often retained in attics, further compounding their reputation as inhospitable environments. However, in recent years, they have been insulated to help decrease heating costs, since uninsulated attics account for 15% of the energy loss in average houses.A loft  or mezzanine is also the uppermost space in a building, but is distinguished from an attic in that an attic typically constitutes an entire floor of the building, while a loft or mezzanine covers only a few rooms, leaving one or more sides open to the lower floor.Attics are found in many different shapes and sizes. They also have many uses: In residential buildings, they are either small unusable spaces filled with insulation, or spaces with storage or HVAC equipment. Some commercial buildings also have attics under pitched roofs that are usually used for storage, mechanical equipment, or for roof access.

Once I have identified the special forces unit, I will search for information on when that unit was founded.3. With that information, I should be able to provide a final answer to the question.The key will be focusing my searches on finding the specific details needed to answer the question, rather than just general information about the topic.

The 12 man ski team under Capt. Littlejohn, and their equipment were widely scattered in the drop, and thereafter found themselves among hostile locals of essentially German origin. Their mission was to block by landslide the main rail lines through the Brenner Pass, thus having a dramatic effect on German reinforcements moving south.The men spent most of their time in hiding and attempts to supply and reinforce by air were unsuccessful. Capt. Littlejohn and Corporal Crowley were captured and executed under Hitler’s Commando Order. Eventually on 31 March the situation had worsened to the point exfiltration was ordered.

Question: This term about a playwright who lived from 1564-1616 presented what about his works? 
Thought 1: Search[playwright 1564-1616]
Action 1: Search[William Shakespeare]
Observation 1: William Shakespeare (c. 23 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" or simply "the Bard". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner ("sharer") of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men after the ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 (around 1613) he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and even certain fringe theories as to whether the works attributed to him were written by others.Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in English. In the last phase of his life he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) such as The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, and collaborated with other playwrights.Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623 John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its preface includes a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, who hailed Shakespeare with the now-famous epithet: "not of an age, but for all time".

At that time, Weider Enterprises consisted primarily of the bodybuilding magazine Muscle & Fitness. Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present Shape, Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine. Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy. MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided. Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1987. Weider was purchased by American Media in 2002. A German version of Shape is available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The magazine is also edited in Romania.Elizabeth Goodman Artis was named Editor-in-Chief in 2014 and held the position until 2021.On January 28, 2015, it was reported that Shape would be acquired by Meredith Corp. and Fitness, published by the company, would cease publication in May 2015 and be combined with it.

- Diagnosis: The previous trial failed because I was unable to find information about a "famous bavagheet" by Arun Date. I searched for information about Arun Date, but did not find any specific details about a famous "bavagheet" (which appears to be a misspelling of "bhavageete", a type of Marathi song). Without being able to find the specific information requested in the question, I was unable to provide the correct answer.New Plan: To answer this question, I will:1. Search for information on "bhavageete" to understand what it is and its significance in Marathi music.2. Search for information on Arun Date's contributions to bhavageete, and try to identify any famous or well-known bhavageete songs/compositions by him.3. Synthesize the information found to provide a concise answer to the original question.

Thought 1: Search[bhavageete]
Action 1: Search[bhavageete]
Observation 1: Bhaavageete or Bhavageeth (literally 'emotion poetry') is a form of poetry and pop music in India. Most of the poetry sung in this genre pertains to subjects like love, nature, and philosophy, and the genre itself is not much different from ghazals, though ghazals are bound to a peculiar metre. This genre is quite popular in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. This genre may be called by different names in other languages. In Telugu, they are known as Bhava Geethaalu. Cherukuri Ramarao is one of the popular writers of Bhava Geethaalu in Telugu.

Thought 4: Based on the information gathered, I was unable to find a specific "famous bavagheet" (likely referring to "bhavageete") composed by Arun Date. The searches indicate that Arun Date was a well-known Marathi singer of bhavageete, which is a form of Marathi poetry and music focused on themes like love, nature, and philosophy. However, I could not find details on any particularly famous or well-known bhavageete compositions by Arun Date. Without being able to identify a specific "famous bavagheet" by Arun Date, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the original question. My apologies, but I am unable to confidently answer this query based on the information available to me.

- The previous trial was unsuccessful because I was unable to find the correct information to answer the question about who is a British physicist and also the British government's chief scientific adviser. A possible reason for the failure is that I did not search broadly enough for the relevant information. Instead of directly searching for "British physicist chief scientific adviser", I should have broken down the query into smaller, more focused searches to gather the necessary details.To mitigate this failure, my new plan would be:1. Search for "British physicists" to find a list of prominent British physicists.2. For each relevant physicist, search for information on their career and government roles.3. Look for any physicists who have also served as the British government's chief scientific adviser.4. Once I identify the relevant person, provide a concise summary of their background and role as the chief scientific adviser.By taking this more systematic approach, I should be able to find the correct answer and provide a well-supported response.

Founded in late 1990 by Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field as a $20 million joint venture with Atlantic Records of Warner Music Group and Interscope Communications, it differed from most record labels by letting A&R staff control decisions and allowing artists and producers full creative control. Interscope's first hit records arrived in under a year, and it achieved profitability in 1993. Chair and CEO until May 2014, Iovine was succeeded by John Janick.In 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive rights to market and distribute releases from hardcore hip hop label Death Row Records, a decision that ultimately put the label at the center of the mid-1990s gangsta rap controversy. As a result, Time Warner, then the parent of Warner Music Group, severed ties with Interscope by selling its 50 percent stake back to Field and Iovine for $115 million in 1995. In 1996, 50% of the label was acquired for a reported $200 million by MCA Inc., later known as Universal Music Group.

Observation 1: Beer Wars is a 2009 documentary film about the American beer industry. In particular, it covers the differences between large corporate breweries, namely Anheuser-Busch, the Miller Brewing Company, and the Coors Brewing Company opposed to smaller breweries like Dogfish Head Brewery, Moonshot 69, Yuengling, Stone Brewing Co., and other producers of craft beer. Also covered is how advertising and lobbyists are used to control the beer market, implying that these things harm competition and consumer choice.Throughout the film, there is a theme that the smallest breweries have next to no chance to compete due to the sheer volume of advertising and outdated beer distribution laws. The original laws demanded a three-tier system to separate the powers of selling beer. The law demands that the beer brewer cannot deliver directly to the retailer, supposedly creating a separation of powers resembling the US government's legislative, judicial, and executive branches. The film claims these laws are now inhibiting growth of smaller brewers and therefore allowing the largest brewers (Coors, Anheuser-Busch, and Miller) to maintain an oligopoly on beer.The film was written, produced, narrated, and directed by Anat Baron, former head of Mike's Hard Lemonade.

The company's best known brand is Arrogant Bastard Ale, which has been described as a "watershed beer" that "put San Diego on the craft brew map." Most of Stone's beers are characteristic of west-coast craft beer, meaning that they have a high hop content, and an average alcohol strength between 6% and 10%.Stone Brewing has been rated as a "world class brewery" by two beer enthusiast websites, RateBeer and BeerAdvocate. Stone Brewing has been voted by the readers of Beer Advocate as the #1 "All Time Top Brewery on Planet Earth."In August 2022, Sapporo Breweries bought Stone for $165 million, with the Stone brewery taking on production of Sapporo beers in California for distribution across North America.

An international audience observed the spectacle. It was the first time that two undefeated boxers who held or had held the world heavyweight title fought each other for that very title.The bout held broad appeal for many Americans, including non-boxing and non-sport fans. Ali, who had been stripped of his titles by boxing authorities for refusing to submit to the draft for the Vietnam War, had become a symbol of the anti-establishment public during his government-imposed exile from the ring. In contrast, Frazier supported U.S. involvement in the war, and he had been adopted by elements of the public with alternate views. In addition, both men possessed intense personal animosity towards each other.Frazier won in fifteen rounds by unanimous decision. Ali dealt with his first professional loss. It became the first of a trio of fights, followed by the rematch events Super Fight II (1974) and the Thrilla in Manila (1975). Both of those fights were won by Ali.

Observation 1: Sleepless in Seattle is a 1993 American romantic comedy film directed by Nora Ephron, from a screenplay written by Jeff Arch, David S. Ward and Ephron. Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the film follows a journalist (Ryan) who becomes enamored with a widowed architect (Hanks) when his son calls in to a talk radio program requesting a new wife for his grieving father. In addition to Bill Pullman, Ross Malinger, and Rob Reiner, the film also features Rosie O'Donnell, Gaby Hoffmann, Victor Garber, Rita Wilson, Barbara Garrick, and Carey Lowell.Inspired by director Leo McCarey's An Affair to Remember (1957), which was a same-script remake of McCarey's Love Affair (1939), Sleepless in Seattle was conceived as a romantic drama by Jeff Arch in 1989. Several studios rejected his script, deterred by the idea that its main couple does not meet for nearly the entire film. Ward and Ephron were hired for script revisions, with Ephron tapped to direct. Although both Hanks and Ryan had been favored for the lead roles from the beginning, several other actors expressed interest in both parts. The film was shot mostly in Seattle during the summer of 1992. Several of its most pivotal scenes were filmed on a former naval base due to the city's lack of sound stages, including a recreation of the Empire State Building's observation deck when the New York skyscraper was not available.Sleepless in Seattle was released on June 25, 1993, to positive reviews, receiving praise for Ephron's writing and direction, as well as Hanks and Ryan's performances. The film received 2 nominations at the 66th Academy Awards: Best Original Screenplay and Best Original Song. Despite competition from several blockbusters released around that same summer, the film was a surprise commercial success, earning $17 million during its opening weekend (the highest opening for a romantic comedy at the time), and ultimately grossing over $227.9 million worldwide. It was one of the highest-grossing films of 1993, and remains one of the most successful romantic comedies in box-office history. Its success extended to the home video market: it was the top rental of 1994 in the United States. The soundtrack was also successful, peaking at number one on the Billboard 200.Several critics and media publications agree that Sleepless in Seattle is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time. The film is also credited with establishing Ephron as a celebrated romantic comedy filmmaker.

The query asked about an American cartoonist, writer, producer, animator, and voice actor who worked with a multiple award-nominated and winning comic book creator, but the search results did not provide a clear answer to this. I should have asked for clarification or additional details about the individuals involved rather than guessing the answer.New Plan:1. Search for more context about the question, such as any additional details about the American cartoonist, writer, producer, animator, and voice actor, or the multiple award-nominated and winning comic book creator.2. If I can find the names of the specific individuals, search for information about their collaboration and work together.3. If I still cannot determine the answer, ask the human for more details or clarification before attempting to provide a final answer.The key is to gather as much relevant information as possible through targeted searches before trying to provide a final answer, rather than guessing.

- Diagnosis: The previous reasoning trial failed because I was unable to find the specific information needed to answer the question about the creature of American folklore that gained notoriety in 1964. I searched for general information about creatures of American folklore, but did not find any details about a specific creature that gained notoriety in 1964.New Plan: To answer this question, I will:1. Search for information on the Loch Ness Monster, as it is a well-known creature of folklore that gained notoriety in the 1960s, to see if that is the correct answer.2. If the Loch Ness Monster is not the correct answer, I will search for information on other famous American folklore creatures, such as Bigfoot or the Jersey Devil, and try to find any details about them gaining notoriety in 1964 specifically.3. If I still cannot find the correct answer, I will try to find a more comprehensive list of American folklore creatures and their histories to see if I can identify the specific one referenced in the question.

Question: What creature of American folklore gained notoriety in 1964?
Thought 1: Search[Loch Ness Monster]
Action 1: Search[Loch Ness Monster]
Observation 1: The Loch Ness Monster (Scottish Gaelic: Uilebheist Loch Nis), known affectionately as Nessie, is a mythical creature in Scottish folklore that is said to inhabit Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. It is often described as large, long-necked, and with one or more humps protruding from the water. Popular interest and belief in the creature has varied since it was brought to worldwide attention in 1933. Evidence of its existence is anecdotal, with a number of disputed photographs and sonar readings.The scientific community explains alleged sightings of the Loch Ness Monster as hoaxes, wishful thinking, and the misidentification of mundane objects. The pseudoscience and subculture of cryptozoology has placed particular emphasis on the creature.
Thought 2: The Loch Ness Monster is not a creature of American folklore, so it is not the correct answer. Let me try searching for other famous American folklore creatures instead.
Action 2: Search[Bigfoot]
Observation 2: Bigfoot (), also commonly referred to as Sasquatch (), is a large, hairy mythical creature said to inhabit forests in North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Bigfoot is featured in both American and Canadian folklore, and since the mid-20th century has become a cultural icon, permeating popular culture and becoming the subject of its own distinct subculture.Enthusiasts of Bigfoot, such as those within the pseudoscience of cryptozoology, have offered various forms of dubious evidence to support Bigfoot's existence, including anecdotal claims of sightings as well as supposed photographs, video and audio recordings, hair samples, and casts of large footprints. However, the evidence is a combination of folklore, misidentification and hoax, and the creature is not a living animal.Folklorists trace the phenomenon of Bigfoot to a combination of factors and sources, including the European wild man figure, folk tales, and indigenous cultures. Examples of similar folk tales of wild, hair-covered humanoids exist throughout the world, such as the Skunk ape of the southeastern United States, the Almas, Yeren, and Yeti in Asia, the Australian Yowie, and creatures in the mythologies of indigenous people. Wishful thinking, a cultural increase in environmental concerns, and overall societal awareness of the subject have been cited as additional factors.
Thought 3: Search[Jersey Devil]
Action 3: Search[Jersey Devil]
Observation 3: In South Jersey and Philadelphia folklore in the United States, the Jersey Devil, also known as the Leeds Devil, is a legendary creature, or cryptid, said to inhabit the forests of the Pine Barrens in South Jersey. The creature is often described as a flying biped with hooves, but there are many variations. The common description is that of a bipedal kangaroo-like or wyvern-like creature with a horse- or goat-like head, leathery bat-like wings, horns, small arms with clawed hands, legs with cloven hooves, and a forked or barbed tail. It is also said that it has a strange elongated body and a thick tail. It has been reported to move quickly and is often described as emitting a high-pitched "blood-curdling scream".

- Apologies, but I was unable to determine the correct mascot for the oldest private university in Georgia based on the information provided. A few potential reasons for the failure:1. I was unable to definitively identify the oldest private university in Georgia from the search results. The information provided did not clearly state which university holds that distinction.2. Even after identifying Emory University as a prominent private university in Georgia, I did not find the specific information about its mascot.

Once the university is identified, search specifically for information on its mascot. Look for pages that discuss the university's sports teams, traditions, or symbols.3.

The Emperor renounced the throne on behalf of himself and his son, Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, in favor of his brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. The next day the Grand Duke refused to accept the imperial authority, stating that he would accept it only if that was the consensus of democratic action by the Russian Constituent Assembly, which shall define the form of government for Russia. With this decision, the rule of the 300-year-old House of Romanov ended. Power in Russia then passed to the Russian Provisional Government, signaling victory for the February Revolution.

Observation 1: William Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 – March 8, 1930) was the 27th president of the United States from 1909 to 1913 and the tenth chief justice of the United States from 1921 to 1930. He is the only person to have held both offices.Taft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. His father, Alphonso Taft, was a U.S. attorney general and secretary of war. Taft attended Yale and joined Skull and Bones, of which his father was a founding member. After becoming a lawyer, Taft was appointed a judge while still in his twenties. He continued a rapid rise, being named solicitor general and a judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1901, President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and he became Roosevelt's hand-picked successor. Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice, Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, believing his political work to be more important.With Roosevelt's help, Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency in that November's election. As president, he focused on East Asia more than European affairs and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments. Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs, then a major source of governmental income, but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests. His administration was filled with conflict between the Republican Party's conservative wing, with which Taft often sympathized, and its progressive wing, toward which Roosevelt moved more and more. Controversies over conservation and antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men. The 1912 presidential election was a three-way race, as Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination. Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates and Roosevelt bolted the party. The split left Taft with little chance of reelection, and he took only Utah and Vermont in his loss to Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson.After leaving office, Taft returned to Yale as a professor, continuing his political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft chief justice, an office he had long sought. Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues, and under him there were advances in individual rights. In poor health, he resigned in February 1930, and died the following month. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there. Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.
Thought 2: The information provided does not contain any details about a railroad that William Howard worked for. The passage is about William Howard Taft, the 27th president of the United States, and does not mention anything about a railroad. To answer this question, I would need to find information specifically about a William Howard associated with a railroad, rather than the president William Howard Taft. Since the current search results do not contain the relevant information, I do not have enough information to determine the original line of the railroad that William Howard worked for.

- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of specific information about the key entities involved (the Rome Protocols, the 2004 film, and the Gator Country guitarist). The searches were too broad and did not provide the necessary details to answer the questions.New Plan:1. For the Rome Protocols question:   - Search for each of the three Prime Ministers (Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula Gömbös) individually to find details about their assassinations and how they were related to the Rome Protocols.   - Synthesize the information from the individual searches to determine what the Prime Ministers were assassinated as part of.2. For the Kam Heskin/Paige Morgan question:   - Search for the specific 2004 film "The Prince & Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, and find the director of that film.   - If the film title is not found, try searching for similar film titles or franchises that Kam Heskin was involved in to find the relevant 2004 film.3

Observation 1: Marvel's Jessica Jones is an American television series created by Melissa Rosenberg for the streaming service Netflix, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the franchise's films, and was the second Marvel Netflix series leading to the crossover miniseries The Defenders (2017). The series was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios and Tall Girls Productions, with Rosenberg serving as showrunner. Scott Reynolds was co-showrunner for the third season.Krysten Ritter stars as Jessica Jones, an ex-superhero turned private investigator who opens her own detective agency, Alias Investigations. Rachael Taylor, Eka Darville, and Carrie-Anne Moss also star, with Mike Colter, Wil Traval, Erin Moriarty, and David Tennant joining them for the first season, J. R. Ramirez, Terry Chen, Leah Gibson, and Janet McTeer joining the cast for the second season, and Benjamin Walker, Sarita Choudhury, Jeremy Bobb, and Tiffany Mack joining for the third season. A version of the series was developed by Rosenberg for ABC in 2010, but the network passed on it. She was reworking it for Netflix by late 2013 as A.K.A. Jessica Jones, with the title later being simplified. Ritter was cast as Jones in December 2014, and the series took specific influence from the character's creators, Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos. Filming took place in New York City, in areas that still look like old Hell's Kitchen.The first season was released in its entirety on Netflix on November 20, 2015, followed by the second on March 8, 2018, and the third on June 14, 2019. They were met with positive reviews, and received numerous accolades including a Peabody Award, Hugo Award, and Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Award. Netflix canceled Jessica Jones on February 18, 2019. All of the Marvel Netflix series were removed from Netflix on March 1, 2022, after Disney regained the license for them. They began streaming on Disney+ from March 16, 2022. Ritter will reprise her role in the second season of the Marvel Studios Disney+ series Daredevil: Born Again (2026).

Observation 1: Mary Poppins is a series of eight children's books written by Australian-British writer P. L. Travers and published over the period 1934 to 1988. Mary Shepard was the illustrator throughout the series. The series began with Mary Poppins in 1934.The books centre on the magical English nanny Mary Poppins, who is blown by the East wind to Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, London, and into the Banks household to care for their children. Encounters with pavement-painters and shopkeepers, and various adventures ensue, until Mary Poppins abruptly leaves, i.e., "pops out". Only the first three of the eight books feature Mary Poppins arriving and leaving. The later five books recount previously unrecorded adventures from her original three visits. As Travers explains in her introduction to Mary Poppins in the Park, "She cannot forever arrive and depart."The books were adapted by Walt Disney into a musical film titled Mary Poppins (1964), starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. The film Saving Mr. Banks (2013) depicted the making of the 1964 film. Disney's sequel to the 1964 film, Mary Poppins Returns, was released in 2018, and stars Emily Blunt as Poppins. In 2004, Disney Theatrical in collaboration with Sir Cameron Mackintosh (who had previously acquired the stage rights from Travers) produced a stage musical also called Mary Poppins in London's West End theatre.

It is also a popular dance at weddings, particularly in whose culture includes polka music. Over 140 versions have been recorded worldwide, including some that were released by Walt Disney Records, together making an estimated 40,000,000 records or more pressed.

- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find relevant information about Alan Dean Foster, which prevented me from determining the common profession shared by John Lanchester and Alan Dean Foster.New Plan:1. Search for "Alan Dean Foster" again, but this time focus on finding information about his profession, not just biographical details.

Question: What profession does John Lanchester and Alan Dean Foster have in common?
Thought 1: Search[Alan Dean Foster]
Action 1: Search[Alan Dean Foster]
Observation 1: Could not find [Alan Dean Foster]. Similar: ['Alan Dean Foster', 'Into the Out Of', 'Humanx Commonwealth', 'Alien: Covenant', 'The Thing (1982 film)', 'The Damned Trilogy', 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen', 'Alan Foster', 'Star Wars original trilogy', 'Midworld']

Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The previous trial failed because I did not fully investigate whether both Lygodium and Maxillaria were genera of orchids. I correctly identified that Maxillaria is a genus of orchids, but I did not confirm that Lygodium is not a genus of orchids.New Plan:

Question: Are both Lygodium or Maxillaria a genus of orchids?
Thought 1: Search[Lygodium]
Action 1: Search[Lygodium]
Observation 1: Lygodium (climbing fern) is a genus of about 40 species of ferns, native to tropical regions across the world, with a few temperate species in eastern Asia and eastern North America. It is the sole genus in the family Lygodiaceae  in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Alternatively, the genus may be placed as the only genus in the subfamily Lygodioideae of a more broadly defined family Schizaeaceae, the family placement used in Plants of the World Online as of November 2019. Per recent molecular evidence, Lygodiaceae is thought to have diverged relatively early from the other members of the Schizaeales due to the relatively high level of synonymous sequence divergence between the families within the Schizaeales.
Thought 2: Search[Maxillaria]
Action 2: Search[Maxillaria]
Observation 2: Maxillaria, abbreviated as Max in the horticultural trade, is a large genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae). This is a diverse genus, with very different morphological forms. Their characteristics can vary widely.They are commonly called spider orchids, flame orchids or tiger orchids. Their scientific name is derived from the Latin word maxilla, meaning jawbone, reflecting on the column and the base of the lip of some species, that may evoke a protruding jaw.
Thought 3: Finish[No, Lygodium is a genus of ferns, not a genus of orchids. Maxillaria is a genus of orchids.]
Action 3: Finish[No, Lygodium is a genus of ferns, not a genus of orchids. Maxillaria is a genus of orchids.]

Action 1: Search[Accession Council]
Observation 1: In the United Kingdom, the Accession Council is a ceremonial body which assembles in St James's Palace in London  upon the death of a monarch to make formal proclamation of the accession of the successor to the throne. Under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, a new monarch succeeds automatically (demise of the Crown). The proclamation confirms by name the identity of the new monarch, expresses loyalty to the "lawful and rightful Liege Lord", and formally announces the new monarch's regnal name, while the council witnesses the signing and sealing of several documents concerning the accession. The privy council (a subset of the accession council) is then called into the presence of the monarch to hear the monarch's address and the witness monarch's signing and sealing of documents. An Accession Council has confirmed every English (and later, British) monarch since James I in 1603.

Observation 2: In 2016, Hillary Clinton ran unsuccessfully for president of the United States. Clinton ran as the Democratic Party's candidate for president, in which she became the first woman to win a presidential nomination by a major U.S. political party. Prior to running, Clinton served as the United States secretary of state in the administration of Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013, a U.S. senator representing New York from 2001 to 2009, and the first lady of the United States, as the wife of Bill Clinton, from 1993 to 2001. She was defeated in the general election by the Republican candidate, businessman Donald Trump.Clinton announced her candidacy on April 12, 2015. Her main competitor in the Democratic primaries was Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran as a more progressive candidate in the primary. Clinton became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party on June 6, 2016, having received the required number of delegates. On July 22, she announced Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate, and the two were formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 26.Clinton received the most support from middle aged and older voters, as well as from African-American, Latino, and older female voters. She focused her platform on several issues, including expanding racial, LGBTQ, and women's rights; raising wages and ensuring equal pay for women; and improving healthcare. Clinton lost the general election to Republican Donald Trump on November 9, 2016; she conceded the following day. Clinton's narrow, unprecedented losses in the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin were considered key to her defeat. These states all had swings from voters who had previously voted for Obama yet went for Trump in 2016. These states have largely rely on manufacturing and part Trump’s campaign appeal was that he would end international trade agreements that hurt American manufacturing. He was outspoken on trade issues.[1]  Had Clinton been elected, she would have been the first female and first spouse of a president to serve as president of the United States, whereas her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, would also have been the first acting first lady since Margaret Woodrow Wilson.

Question: The W. H. Shipman House is in what Hawaii county?
Thought 1: Search[W. H. Shipman House]
Action 1: Search[W. H. Shipman House]
Observation 1: W. H. Shipman House is a historic home used by William Herbert Shipman.  It is located at 141 Kaʻiulani Street, named for Princess Kaʻiulani, the last crown princess of the Kingdom and Liliʻuokalani's niece.In 1856 King Kamehameha IV leased an area known as Kolo iki to William Reed for cattle pasture. In 1861 Reed purchased the 26 acres (11 ha) and it came to be known as "Reed's Island". It is not really an island, but the area between a current and ancient channel of the Wailuku River.J. R. "Jack" Wilson owned Volcano Stables, a horse rental business at the current site of the historic Volcano Block Building in Hilo. In 1899 after an iron bridge was completed, Wilson bought a 8-acre (3.2 ha) lot with a view on Reed's island and built a large house in the Victorian architecture style. It was designed by Honolulu architect Henry Livingston Kerr, and constructed with indoor plumbing and electricity. In addition to the main house placed prominently on a hill the estate includes a guest house, servants' quarters, gardens, and a garage. An unusual feature is the two-story round tower with conical roof, circular veranda, and large curved panes of glass.In February 1901 William Shipman bought the house to entertain guests in the growing city of Hilo.Deposed Queen Liliʻuokalani would play her compositions at the grand piano when she was visiting.Author Jack London and his wife stayed at this house for five weeks in August and September 1907, while his boat The Snark was being repaired. London's book The Cruise of the Snark (1911) is based on this journey. In the early 1930s, Cecil B. DeMille filmed Four Frightened People in the gulch below the house, as well as on the Shipman land in Puna. In 1939 artist Georgia O'Keeffe stayed and was shown various sites that appeared in her paintings.The Hilo house was listed on the state register of historic places on December 5, 1973, as site 10-35-7405, and the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on June 23, 1978, as site 78001013.Barbara-Ann Andersen (daughter of Roy Shipman Blackshear, a great-granddaughter of W. H. Shipman) restored the house and operated it for roughly 20 years starting in 1997 as a bed and breakfast hotel.
Thought 2: Based on the information provided, the W. H. Shipman House is located in Hawaii County. The passage states that the house is located in Hilo, which is on the island of Hawaii, part of Hawaii County.

Observation 1: Nicolae Titulescu (Romanian pronunciation: [nikoˈla.e tituˈlesku]; 4 March 1882 – 17 March 1941) was a Romanian politician and diplomat, at various times ambassador, finance minister, and foreign minister, and for two terms served as president of the General Assembly of the League of Nations (1930–32).
Thought 2: Search[League of Nations]
Action 2: Search[League of Nations]
Observation 2: The League of Nations (LN or LoN; French: Société des Nations [sɔsjete de nɑsjɔ̃], SdN) was the first worldwide intergovernmental organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. It was founded on 10 January 1920 by the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War. The main organisation ceased operations on 18 April 1946 when many of its components were relocated into the new United Nations (UN) which was created in the aftermath of the Second World War.The League's primary goals were stated in its eponymous Covenant. They included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Its other concerns included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe. The Covenant of the League of Nations was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, and it became effective with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920. Australia was granted the right to participate as an autonomous member nation, marking the start of Australian independence on the global stage. The first meeting of the Council of the League took place on 16 January 1920, and the first meeting of the Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920. In 1919, U.S. president Woodrow Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role as the leading architect of the League. Despite this, he was ultimately unsuccessful in getting his country to join it.The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious Allied Powers of World War I (Britain, France, Italy and Japan were the initial permanent members of the Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement medical tents, Benito Mussolini responded that "the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out."At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. After some notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. Its credibility was weakened because the United States never joined. Japan and Germany left in 1933, Italy left in 1937, and Spain left in 1939. The Soviet Union only joined in 1934 and was expelled in 1939 after invading Finland. Furthermore, the League demonstrated an irresolute approach to sanction enforcement for fear it might only spark further conflict, further decreasing its credibility. One example of this hesitancy was the Abyssinia Crisis, in which Italy's sanctions were only limited from the outset (coal and oil were not restricted), and later altogether abandoned despite Italy being declared the aggressors in the conflict. The onset of the Second World War in 1939 showed that the League had failed its primary purpose: to prevent another world war. It was largely inactive until its abolition. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations effectively replaced it in 1945, inheriting several agencies and organisations founded by the League, with the League itself formally dissolving the following year.Current scholarly consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its main goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, gave a voice to smaller nations; fostered economic stabilisation and financial stability, especially in Central Europe in the 1920s; helped to raise awareness of problems such as epidemics, slavery, child labour, colonial tyranny, refugee crises and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation. Professor David Kennedy portrays the League as a unique moment when international affairs were "institutionalised", as opposed to the pre–First World War methods of law and politics.

Observation 1: Otterington railway station was located in the village of South Otterington, North Yorkshire, on the East Coast Main Line. It opened in 1841 and closed in 1958. The station is now a private residence, though the platform can still be seen. The buildings date from the 1930s when the East Coast Main Line was widened.The station became a listed building in 2018.
Thought 2: Search[East Coast Main Line]
Action 2: Search[East Coast Main Line]
Observation 2: The East Coast Main Line (ECML) is a 393-mile-long (632 km) electrified railway between its northern terminus at Edinburgh Waverley and southern terminus at London King's Cross.  Peterborough, Doncaster, York, Darlington, Durham and Newcastle are on the line, which is a key transport artery on the eastern side of Great Britain running broadly parallel to the A1 road. The main line acts as a 'spine' for several diverging branches, serving destinations such as Cambridge, Leeds, Hull, Sunderland and Lincoln, all with direct services to London. In addition, a few ECML services extend beyond Edinburgh to serve other Scottish destinations, such as Stirling, Inverness, Dundee, or Aberdeen.The line was built during the 1840s by three railway companies, the North British Railway, the North Eastern Railway, and the Great Northern Railway. In 1923, the Railways Act 1921 led to their amalgamation to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the line became its primary route. The LNER competed with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) for long-distance passenger traffic between London and Scotland. The LNER's chief mechanical engineer Nigel Gresley designed iconic Pacific steam locomotives including Flying Scotsman and Mallard, the latter of which achieved a world record speed for a steam locomotive, 126 mph (203 km/h) on the Grantham-to-Peterborough section on 3 July 1938.In 1948, the railways were nationalised and operated by British Railways. In the early 1960s, steam was replaced by diesel-electric traction, including the Deltics, and sections of the line were upgraded so that trains could run at speeds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h). With the demand for higher speed, British Rail introduced InterCity 125 high-speed trains between 1976 and 1981. In 1973, a Class 41 (an HST prototype) achieved a top speed of 143 mph (230 km/h) in a test run. In the 1980s, the line was electrified and InterCity 225 trains introduced. These have in turn been largely replaced by Class 800 and Class 801 units. The November 2021 Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands stated that the linespeed would be upgraded to 140 mph (225 km/h).The line links London, South East England, East Anglia and the East Midlands, with Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland, and is important to their local economies. It carries commuter traffic in north London as well as cross-country, commuter and local passenger services, and freight. In 1997, operations were privatised. The primary long-distance operator is London North Eastern Railway, but open-access competition on services to Northern England and Scotland is provided by Hull Trains, Grand Central and Lumo.
Thought 3: Based on the information provided, the Otterington railway station was located on the East Coast Main Line, which is a 393-mile railway line that links Edinburgh to London King's Cross. Therefore, the city that the East Coast Main Line linked Edinburgh to is London.

Thought 2: Search[Patti Page]
Action 2: Search[Patti Page]
Observation 2: Clara Ann Fowler (November 8, 1927 – January 1, 2013), better known by her stage name Patti Page, was an American singer. Primarily known for pop and country music, she was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six-decade-long career. She was often introduced as "the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page". New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as "A Page in my life called Patti".Page signed with Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948's "Confess". In 1950, she had her first million-selling single "With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming", and eventually had 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965.Page's signature song, "Tennessee Waltz", is the best selling song of the 1950s by a female artist, one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is recognized today as one of the official songs of the state of Tennessee. It spent 13 weeks atop the Billboard's best-sellers list in 1950/51. Page had three additional number-one hit singles between 1950 and 1953, "All My Love (Bolero)", "I Went to Your Wedding", and "(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?".Unlike most other pop singers, Page blended country music styles into many of her songs. As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page's singles appeared on the Billboard Country Chart. In the 1970s, she shifted her style more toward country music and began having even more success on the country charts, ending up as one of the few vocalists to have charted in five separate decades.With the rise of rock and roll in the 1950s, mainstream popular music record sales began to decline. Page was among the few pop singers who were able to maintain popularity, continuing to have hits well into the 1960s, with "Old Cape Cod", "Allegheny Moon", "A Poor Man's Roses (or a Rich Man's Gold)", and "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte".In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. She was posthumously honored with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2013.

Observation 2: The New York and New Jersey campaign in 1776 and the winter months of 1777 was a series of American Revolutionary War battles for control of the Port of New York and the state of New Jersey, fought between British forces under General Sir William Howe and the Continental Army under General George Washington.  Howe was successful in driving Washington out of New York, but overextended his reach into New Jersey, and ended the New York and New Jersey campaign in January 1777 with only a few outposts near New York City under British control. The British held New York Harbor for the rest of the Revolutionary War, using it as a base for expeditions against other targets.Landing unopposed on Staten Island on July 3, 1776, Howe had assembled an army that included components that had withdrawn from Boston in March following the British failure to hold that city, combined with additional British troops, and Hessian troops hired from several German principalities. Washington's Continental Army included New England soldiers and regiments from the Thirteen Colonies as far south as the Colony of Virginia. Landing on Long Island in August, Howe defeated Washington in the largest battle of the war in North America, but the Continental Army was able to regroup and make an orderly and covert retreat to Manhattan that night under a cover of darkness and fog. Washington suffered a series of further defeats in Manhattan but prevailed in a skirmish at the Battle of Harlem Heights and eventually withdrew his troops successfully to White Plains, New York. Howe, meanwhile, returned to Manhattan and captured those forces Washington had left on the island.Washington and much of his army crossed the Hudson River to Rockland County and then south into New Jersey, retreated across the state, and then crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. Along the way, his army shrank due to the ending of enlistment periods, desertions, and poor morale. Howe ordered his troops into winter quarters in December, establishing a chain of outposts from New York City to Burlington, New Jersey.  Washington, in a tremendous boost to American morale, launched a successful strike against the Trenton garrison on the morning of December 26, 1776, prompting Howe to withdraw his chain of outposts back to New Brunswick and the coast near New York. Washington, in turn, established his winter camp at Morristown.  During the following winter months and through the rest of the war, both sides skirmished frequently around New York City and New Jersey as the British sought forage and provisions.Britain maintained control of New York City and some of the surrounding territory until the war ended in 1783, using it as a base for operations elsewhere in North America.  In 1777, General Howe launched a campaign to capture the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia, leaving General Sir Henry Clinton in command of the New York area, while General John Burgoyne led an attempt to gain control of the Hudson River valley, moving south from Quebec and being defeated at Saratoga.

Observation 2: The Dark Tower is a series of eight novels, one novella, and a children's book written by American author Stephen King. Incorporating themes from multiple genres, including dark fantasy, science fantasy, horror, and Western, it describes a "gunslinger" and his quest toward a tower, the nature of which is both physical and metaphorical. The series, and its use of the Dark Tower, expands upon Stephen King's multiverse and in doing so, links together many of his other novels.In addition to the eight novels of the series proper that comprise 4,250 pages, many of King's other books relate to the story, introducing concepts and characters that come into play as the series progresses.The series was chiefly inspired by the poem "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came" by Robert Browning, the full text of which was included in the final volume's appendix. In the preface to the revised 2003 edition of The Gunslinger, King also identifies The Lord of the Rings, Arthurian legend, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as inspirations. He identifies Clint Eastwood's "Man with No Name" character as one of the major inspirations for the protagonist, Roland Deschain. King's style of location names in the series, such as Mid-World, and his development of a unique language (High Speech), are also influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien's work.A film based on Stephen King's novel series was released in August 2017.

However, I did not find the connection that this group later became the giant silverware company Oneida Limited, which was run by Pierrepont Noyes. I focused too much on the Oneida Community itself and did not make the necessary link to the silverware company.New plan:1. Search for information on the Oneida Community and its connection to the silverware company.2. Specifically look for information on Pierrepont Noyes and his role in running the silverware company.3. Synthesize the information to provide a concise answer to the original question.

Action 1: Search[Oneida Community]
Observation 1: The Oneida Community ( oh-NYE-də) was a perfectionist religious communal society founded by John Humphrey Noyes and his followers in 1848 near Oneida, New York. The community believed that Jesus had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about Jesus's millennial kingdom themselves, and be perfect and free of sin in this world, not just in Heaven (a belief called perfectionism). The Oneida Community practiced communalism (in the sense of communal property and possessions), group marriage, male sexual continence, Oneida stirpiculture (a form of eugenics), and mutual criticism.The community's original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878. There were smaller Noyesian communities in Wallingford, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; Putney and Cambridge, Vermont. The branches were closed in 1854 except for the Wallingford branch, which operated until the 1878 tornado devastated it.The Oneida Community dissolved in 1881, converting itself to a joint-stock company. This eventually became the silverware company Oneida Limited, one of the largest in the world.

In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the exact title of the 2004 film, when I should have tried searching for similar film titles from that year.

Observation 1: The Missouri Compromise (also known as the Compromise of 1820) was federal legislation of the United States that balanced the desires of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it. It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. While the slave states earlier claimed Federal protection for slavery, they now objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and claimed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana Purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. "[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality." "The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states."When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise provision that banned slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was controversial.  While it mollified most people at the time and settled the issue for more than 20 years, many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along regional and sectarian lines.  Tensions resumed in the 1840s and the Compromise of 1850 only briefly defused the situation. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.

Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative and nationalist government. This crisis culminated in the self-elimination of the Austrian Parliament, a coup sparked by the resignation of the presiding officers of the National Council. Suppressing the Socialist movement in the Austrian Civil War and later banning the Austrian Nazi Party, he cemented his rule through the First of May Constitution in 1934. Later that year, Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitler's Anschluss in 1938.

- Diagnosis: The main issue in the previous trials was that I was unable to find the specific information needed to answer the questions. In the first trial, I was able to find information about Benito Mussolini and his assassination, but I did not search for the other two prime ministers or make the connection to the Rome Protocols. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific 2004 film "The Prince and Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, but could not locate the page. In the third trial, I was unable to find the specific Shakespeare tragedy with the character Benvolio, even after multiple searches.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will take a more systematic approach to searching for information. Rather than jumping straight to trying to answer the question, I will first thoroughly search for all the key entities and details mentioned in the question. I will make sure to search for each individual piece of information, and then synthesize the results to formulate a final answer.

Action 2: Search[Antic]
Observation 2: An attic (sometimes referred to as a loft) is a space found directly below the pitched roof of a house or other building. It is also known as a sky parlor or a garret. Because they fill the space between the ceiling of a building's top floor and its slanted roof, attics are known for being awkwardly-shaped spaces with difficult-to-reach corners and often exposed rafters.While some attics are converted into bedrooms, home offices, or attic apartments complete with windows and staircases, most remain difficult to access, and are usually entered using a loft hatch and ladder. Attics help control temperatures in a house by providing a large mass of slowly moving air, and are often used for storage. The hot air rising from the lower floors of a building is often retained in attics, further compounding their reputation as inhospitable environments. However, in recent years, they have been insulated to help decrease heating costs, since uninsulated attics account for 15% of the energy loss in average houses.A loft  or mezzanine is also the uppermost space in a building, but is distinguished from an attic in that an attic typically constitutes an entire floor of the building, while a loft or mezzanine covers only a few rooms, leaving one or more sides open to the lower floor.Attics are found in many different shapes and sizes. They also have many uses: In residential buildings, they are either small unusable spaces filled with insulation, or spaces with storage or HVAC equipment. Some commercial buildings also have attics under pitched roofs that are usually used for storage, mechanical equipment, or for roof access.
Thought 3: I do not have enough information to determine the year when The Chronicle of Philanthropy's publishing overlapped with Antic. The search results provide background information on The Chronicle of Philanthropy and Antic, but do not mention any overlap in their publishing timelines. To answer this question, I would need to find more specific information on the founding and publishing dates of both publications to see if there was any period where they were published concurrently. Without that information, I cannot provide a definitive answer.

Question: This term about a playwright who lived from 1564-1616 presented what about his works? 
Thought 1: Search[William Shakespeare]
Action 1: Search[William Shakespeare]
Observation 1: William Shakespeare (c. 23 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" or simply "the Bard". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner ("sharer") of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men after the ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 (around 1613) he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and even certain fringe theories as to whether the works attributed to him were written by others.Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in English. In the last phase of his life he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) such as The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, and collaborated with other playwrights.Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623 John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its preface includes a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, who hailed Shakespeare with the now-famous epithet: "not of an age, but for all time".

Observation 2: Shape (stylized in all caps) is an American monthly fitness magazine started by Weider Publications in 1981, founded by Christine MacIntyre (a pioneer in women's free weight fitness) and became the number one women's fitness magazine. At that time, Weider Enterprises consisted primarily of the bodybuilding magazine Muscle & Fitness. Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present Shape, Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine. Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy. MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided. Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1987. Weider was purchased by American Media in 2002. A German version of Shape is available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The magazine is also edited in Romania.Elizabeth Goodman Artis was named Editor-in-Chief in 2014 and held the position until 2021.On January 28, 2015, it was reported that Shape would be acquired by Meredith Corp. and Fitness, published by the company, would cease publication in May 2015 and be combined with it.

Observation 2: Joe Frazier vs. Muhammad Ali, billed as The Fight of the Century or simply The Fight, was an undisputed heavyweight championship boxing match between WBA, WBC, and The Ring heavyweight champion Joe Frazier and Lineal champion  Muhammad Ali, on Monday, March 8, 1971, at Madison Square Garden in New York City.The fight is widely regarded as the biggest boxing match in history and arguably the single most anticipated and publicized sporting event of all time. An international audience observed the spectacle. It was the first time that two undefeated boxers who held or had held the world heavyweight title fought each other for that very title.The bout held broad appeal for many Americans, including non-boxing and non-sport fans. Ali, who had been stripped of his titles by boxing authorities for refusing to submit to the draft for the Vietnam War, had become a symbol of the anti-establishment public during his government-imposed exile from the ring. In contrast, Frazier supported U.S. involvement in the war, and he had been adopted by elements of the public with alternate views. In addition, both men possessed intense personal animosity towards each other.Frazier won in fifteen rounds by unanimous decision. Ali dealt with his first professional loss. It became the first of a trio of fights, followed by the rematch events Super Fight II (1974) and the Thrilla in Manila (1975). Both of those fights were won by Ali.

They entered the season as the defending World Series champions after winning their eighth World Series title in franchise history, and finished the season by successfully defending their title for the first time in franchise history, winning their ninth title in the 2025 World Series over the Toronto Blue Jays, 4–3.For the second year in a row, the Dodgers began the season outside of America, this time in Tokyo, Japan for the Tokyo Series. They became the first defending World Series champion to begin their season 8–0, besting the previous record held by the 1933 Yankees, who started their season 7–0. The Dodgers clinched their 13th straight post-season appearance on September 19, extending the longest streak in franchise history. On September 25, they clinched the National League West title for the fourth straight season and 12th time the last 13 years.On September 18, 3-time Cy Young winner and former MVP Clayton Kershaw announced his retirement at the conclusion of the season. The team passed 4 million in home attendance for the first time in franchise history.As the third seed, the Dodgers opened the playoffs in the Wild Card Series against the sixth seed, Cincinnati Reds. They swept the Reds in two games to advance to the NLDS. They then defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in four games and advanced to the National League Championship Series for the second year in a row. They swept the Milwaukee Brewers in four games to win their second straight NLCS and the fifth in nine years (2017–2018, 2020, 2024–2025), in a series defined by their starting pitching dominance. They defeated the Blue Jays in the World Series in seven games to become the first franchise to repeat as World Series champions since the 1998–2000 New York Yankees. The Dodgers were just the ninth team to win Games 6 and 7 on the road in a World Series. In Game 7, they were the first team in MLB history to stage a comeback on the road in the ninth inning of a winner-take-all World Series game, ultimately winning in 11 innings by a score of 5-4. Unlike last season, the Dodgers did not hold home-advantage for any of the last three rounds.
Thought 2: The search results do not contain any information about a professional baseball player born in 1984 who played as a rookie for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2007. The results are about the 2025 Los Angeles Dodgers season, which is not relevant to the question. I do not have enough information to determine the answer to this question based on the available search results. I will indicate that I cannot determine the answer.

Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trial was the inability to find the specific information needed to answer the question. The searches conducted did not provide the necessary details about Maroon 5's discography and the lead vocalist for each of their studio albums.New Plan:1. Search for "Maroon 5 discography" to get an overview of their studio album releases.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find the specific information needed to answer the questions. In the first trial, I should have searched for more details on each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols, rather than just focusing on one. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the exact title of the 2004 film, when I should have tried searching for more general information about the film franchise. In the third trial, I was unable to find Maroon 5's full discography, which prevented me from determining the lead vocalist for their sixth studio album.New Plan: To mitigate these types of failures in the future, I will adopt a more systematic and comprehensive approach to information gathering. Rather than relying on a single search or piece of information, I will:1. Perform a broader initial search to get an overview of the topic, then gradually narrow down to more specific details.2. Cross-reference multiple reliable sources to corroborate and fill in any gaps in the information.3. If I'm unable to find the exact details needed to answer a question, I will acknowledge the limitations

Thought 4: I apologize, but I do not have enough information to determine the lead vocalist for Maroon 5's sixth studio album.

- I apologize, but I was unable to determine the correct answer based on the information provided in the previous trial. The key issues were:1. I was unable to find any information about the distribution of XXXTentacion's single "Revenge". The search results focused on general information about Empire Distribution, but did not mention anything specific about the distribution of that particular song.2. I made an assumption that since Empire Distribution is based in San Francisco, they must have distributed XXXTentacion's single. However, this was not confirmed in the information I had access to.To improve, I would need to:1. Specifically search for information on who distributed XXXTentacion's single "Revenge". This may require finding more details on the release and distribution of that particular song.2. Avoid making assumptions and stick to only the information that is directly stated in the search results. I should not have jumped to the conclusion that San Francisco was the answer without confirming that detail.3.

Observation 2: Empire Distribution, Records and Publishing Inc. (stylized as EMPIRE) is an independent American record label, distribution and publishing company founded in 2010 by Ghazi Shami. Based in San Francisco, EMPIRE has offices in New York, London, Lagos, and Johannesburg in addition to recording studios in San Francisco and New York.Shami, a San Francisco native with a background in music and tech, founded Empire as a digital distribution company focused on hip hop and rap.  Developing proprietary software that allowed managers and artists to easily track airplay and sales, Empire paid monthly royalties to artists, many of whom had not previously earned digital revenue, and gained early support from the Bay Area's artist community.In 2014, Shami, known as Ghazi, launched the Empire label. Empire Africa, Empire Latino, and Empire Nashville divisions were later established. Since its founding—in partnership with artists and artist labels—Empire has released music by artists including Kendrick Lamar, Anderson .Paak, Shaboozey, Fat Joe, Tyga, Asake, Fireboy DML, XXXTentacion, G-Dragon, Philthy Rich, Young Dolph, Key Glock, King Von, Tink, Black Sherif, Yung Bleu, D Smoke, T-Pain, Snoop Dogg, DRAM, Cardi B and Emtee, among others.

The searches indicate that Empire Distribution, the company that released music by XXXTentacion, is headquartered in San Francisco. However, there is no specific information about where the "Revenge" single was distributed from. Without that level of detail, I cannot confidently provide the location. The best I can say is that the single was likely distributed by Empire Distribution, which is based in San Francisco, but I cannot state that as a definitive fact. I apologize that I do not have a more complete answer, but I want to avoid making unsupported assumptions. If more specific information about the distribution of that particular song becomes available, I would be happy to revisit this and provide a more definitive answer.

Observation 3: Caratacus was a 1st-century AD British chieftain of the Catuvellauni tribe, who resisted the Roman conquest of Britain.Before the Roman invasion, Caratacus is associated with the expansion of his tribe's territory. His apparent success led to Roman invasion, nominally in support of his defeated enemies. He resisted the Romans for almost a decade, using guerrilla warfare, but when he offered a set-piece battle he was defeated by Roman forces. After defeat he fled to the territory of Queen Cartimandua, who captured him and handed him over to the Romans. He was sentenced to death but made a speech before his execution that persuaded the Emperor Claudius to spare him. Caratacus' speech to Claudius has been a popular subject in visual art.

Observation 1: Sleepless in Seattle is a 1993 American romantic comedy film directed by Nora Ephron, from a screenplay written by Jeff Arch, David S. Ward and Ephron. Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the film follows a journalist (Ryan) who becomes enamored with a widowed architect (Hanks) when his son calls in to a talk radio program requesting a new wife for his grieving father. In addition to Bill Pullman, Ross Malinger, and Rob Reiner, the film also features Rosie O'Donnell, Gaby Hoffmann, Victor Garber, Rita Wilson, Barbara Garrick, and Carey Lowell.Inspired by director Leo McCarey's An Affair to Remember (1957), which was a same-script remake of McCarey's Love Affair (1939), Sleepless in Seattle was conceived as a romantic drama by Jeff Arch in 1989. Several studios rejected his script, deterred by the idea that its main couple does not meet for nearly the entire film. Ward and Ephron were hired for script revisions, with Ephron tapped to direct. Although both Hanks and Ryan had been favored for the lead roles from the beginning, several other actors expressed interest in both parts. The film was shot mostly in Seattle during the summer of 1992. Several of its most pivotal scenes were filmed on a former naval base due to the city's lack of sound stages, including a recreation of the Empire State Building's observation deck when the New York skyscraper was not available.Sleepless in Seattle was released on June 25, 1993, to positive reviews, receiving praise for Ephron's writing and direction, as well as Hanks and Ryan's performances. The film received 2 nominations at the 66th Academy Awards: Best Original Screenplay and Best Original Song. Despite competition from several blockbusters released around that same summer, the film was a surprise commercial success, earning $17 million during its opening weekend (the highest opening for a romantic comedy at the time), and ultimately grossing over $227.9 million worldwide. It was one of the highest-grossing films of 1993, and remains one of the most successful romantic comedies in box-office history. Its success extended to the home video market: it was the top rental of 1994 in the United States. The soundtrack was also successful, peaking at number one on the Billboard 200.Several critics and media publications agree that Sleepless in Seattle is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time. The film is also credited with establishing Ephron as a celebrated romantic comedy filmmaker.

- The reason for the failure in the previous trial was that I did not have enough specific information to determine the CBS-affiliated station that serves Pontotoc County, Oklahoma. The searches I performed provided general information about Pontotoc County, but did not return any details about the local television market and station coverage.To mitigate this failure, I would devise a new plan that focuses on finding more targeted information about the television stations and their coverage areas in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma.

The Emperor renounced the throne on behalf of himself and his son, Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, in favor of his brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. The next day the Grand Duke refused to accept the imperial authority, stating that he would accept it only if that was the consensus of democratic action by the Russian Constituent Assembly, which shall define the form of government for Russia. With this decision, the rule of the 300-year-old House of Romanov ended. Power in Russia then passed to the Russian Provisional Government, signaling victory for the February Revolution.

- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find the specific information needed to answer the questions. In the first trial, I was able to find information about Benito Mussolini and his assassination, but I did not search for the other two prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols or their fates. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific 2004 film "The Prince & Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, but could not find the relevant information. In the third trial, I was unable to find any information about "Flower Alley" or the trainer who was killed at a Fayette County, Kentucky airport.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will take a more systematic approach to searching for information. Instead of jumping straight to trying to answer the question, I will first search for the key entities and concepts mentioned in the question, and gather as much relevant information as possible before attempting to synthesize an answer. This will involve:1. Identifying the key entities and concepts in the question (e.g. Rome Protocols, Kam Heskin, Flower
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of relevant information available on Wikipedia about the specific entities mentioned in the questions. The queries involved details about a horse named "Flower Alley" and a trainer who was killed at a Fayette County, Kentucky airport, but these details could not be found through the provided search functionality.New Plan:1. Search for more general information about horse racing, trainers, and notable incidents to build a broader context.2. Attempt to find any connections or clues that could lead to the specific details about Flower Alley and the trainer incident.3. If the key entities cannot be found, acknowledge the lack of information and explain that the query cannot be answered satisfactorily with the available data.The goal is to gather as much relevant background information as possible, while also being transparent about the limitations of the knowledge base. This approach should help mitigate the failure experienced in the previous trials by providing a more comprehensive and honest response.

- The previous trial was unsuccessful because the information provided was about William Howard Taft, the 27th president of the United States, rather than the William Howard associated with a railroad. To answer this question, I would need to find information specifically about a William Howard who worked for a railroad, rather than the president William Howard Taft.A new, concise, high-level plan to mitigate this failure would be:1. Search for "William Howard railroad" to try to find information about a William Howard associated with a railroad, rather than the president.2. If the search results do not contain the relevant information, try searching for more specific details about the railroad William Howard worked for.3. If I still cannot find the information needed to answer the question, I will acknowledge that I do not have enough information to determine the original line of the railroad that William Howard worked for.By focusing the search on finding information about the specific William Howard associated with a railroad, rather than the president, I can avoid the mistake of providing irrelevant information and better address the original question.

Question: Where was the original line of the railroad William Howard worked for?
Thought 1: Search[William Howard railroad]
Action 1: Search[William Howard railroad]
Observation 1: William Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 – March 8, 1930) was the 27th president of the United States from 1909 to 1913 and the tenth chief justice of the United States from 1921 to 1930. He is the only person to have held both offices.Taft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. His father, Alphonso Taft, was a U.S. attorney general and secretary of war. Taft attended Yale and joined Skull and Bones, of which his father was a founding member. After becoming a lawyer, Taft was appointed a judge while still in his twenties. He continued a rapid rise, being named solicitor general and a judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1901, President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and he became Roosevelt's hand-picked successor. Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice, Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, believing his political work to be more important.With Roosevelt's help, Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency in that November's election. As president, he focused on East Asia more than European affairs and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments. Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs, then a major source of governmental income, but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests. His administration was filled with conflict between the Republican Party's conservative wing, with which Taft often sympathized, and its progressive wing, toward which Roosevelt moved more and more. Controversies over conservation and antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men. The 1912 presidential election was a three-way race, as Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination. Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates and Roosevelt bolted the party. The split left Taft with little chance of reelection, and he took only Utah and Vermont in his loss to Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson.After leaving office, Taft returned to Yale as a professor, continuing his political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft chief justice, an office he had long sought. Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues, and under him there were advances in individual rights. In poor health, he resigned in February 1930, and died the following month. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there. Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.
Thought 2: The information provided does not contain any details about a William Howard associated with a railroad. The passage is about William Howard Taft, the 27th president of the United States, and does not mention anything about a railroad that he worked for. To answer this question, I would need to find information specifically about a William Howard who was involved with a railroad, rather than the president William Howard Taft. Since I do not have the relevant information to determine the original line of the railroad that William Howard worked for, I will have to provide:

Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of specific information about the key entities involved (the Rome Protocols, the 2004 film, and the Gator Country guitarist). The searches were too broad and did not provide the necessary details to answer the questions.New Plan:1. For the Rome Protocols question:   - Search for each of the three Prime Ministers (Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula Gömbös) individually to find details about their assassinations and how they were related to the Rome Protocols.   - Synthesize the information from the individual searches to determine what the Prime Ministers were assassinated as part of.2. For the Kam Heskin/Paige Morgan question:   - Search for the specific 2004 film "The Prince & Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, and find the director of that film.   - If the film title is not found, try searching for similar film titles or franchises that Kam Heskin was involved in to find the relevant 2004 film.3
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of specific information about the key details in the questions. In the first trial, I should have searched for each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols and looked up details about their deaths, rather than just focusing on Mussolini. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific 2004 film "The Prince & Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, instead of looking for similar films or franchises that may have been relevant. In the third trial, the question about a Gator Country guitarist co-writing a song called "Bloody Reunion" did not have enough contextual information for me to determine the relevant band.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will focus on the following:1. Ask clarifying questions: If a question does not provide enough specific details, I will ask the user for additional context or information that could help me better understand the key elements of the question.2. Conduct more comprehensive searches: Instead of just searching for one or two key terms, I will try to search for multiple related entities, events, or details

Question: What band did Gator Country guitarist that co-wrote Bloody Reunion come from?
Thought 1: Search[Gator Country guitarist Bloody Reunion]
Action 1: Search[Gator Country]
Observation 1: Gator Country was an American Southern rock band formed in Davie, Florida, in 2005 by several ex-members of the Southern rock group Molly Hatchet.  The band, founded by vocalist Jimmy Farrar, guitarist Duane Roland, drummer Bruce Crump, guitarist Steve Holland, and bassist Riff West took its name from the title of the hit song, "Gator Country".In 2006, Gator Country, led by vocalist Jimmy Farrar, continued to perform popular songs such as "Beatin' The Odds", "Bounty Hunter" as well as "Oh Atlanta".

Observation 2: Bloody Reunion (Korean: 스승의 은혜; RR: Seuseungui eunhye) (aka To Sir, with Love, My Teacher or Teacher's Mercy) is a 2006 South Korean horror film, and the feature film debut of director Im Dae-Woong.
Thought 3: The information provided does not seem to contain any details about a Gator Country guitarist co-writing a song called "Bloody Reunion". The search results mention a Southern rock band called Gator Country and a South Korean horror film called "Bloody Reunion", but there is no connection between the two. I do not have enough information to determine what band the Gator Country guitarist who co-wrote "Bloody Reunion" came from. I will need more specific details about this guitarist and the song in order to answer the question.

Action 1: Search[Marvel Netflix series]
Observation 1: Marvel's Netflix television series are a set of interconnected American television series created for the streaming service Netflix, based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. Produced by Marvel Television and ABC Studios, they are set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the franchise's films and other television series. Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb revealed the group of shows were known internally as the "Marvel Street-Level Heroes" or "Marvel Knights" series.A deal between Marvel and Netflix to produce several interconnected series was announced in November 2013, with the individual series Daredevil (2015–2018), Jessica Jones (2015–2019), Luke Cage (2016–2018), and Iron Fist (2017–2018) culminating in the crossover miniseries The Defenders (2017). A spin-off from Daredevil, The Punisher (2017–2019), was ordered in April 2016. The series were all filmed in New York State, forming the state's largest television production commitment across 161 episodes. They star Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones, Mike Colter as Luke Cage, and Finn Jones as Danny Rand / Iron Fist, who all star together in The Defenders, as well as Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher. Many actors have roles across the different series, including Rosario Dawson who signed a special deal to portray Claire Temple.The series are believed to have generated strong viewership for Netflix, who do not release exact viewership details, and received positive reviews for their casts and darker take on the MCU. There were some common criticisms of the series, such as for their pacing. Netflix had cancelled all of the series by February 2019, when Marvel's parent company Disney was preparing its own streaming service, Disney+. The series were all removed from Netflix on March 1, 2022, after Disney regained the licenses for them, and they began streaming on Disney+ from March 16, where they were collected under the title "The Defenders Saga".Contractually, Marvel had to wait two years before they could use the characters without Netflix. Vincent D'Onofrio and Cox were the first actors to reprise their roles in Marvel Studios-produced MCU projects, in December 2021. A new Daredevil series, titled Daredevil: Born Again, premiered in 2025 on Disney+, with Cox, D'Onofrio, Bernthal, other Daredevil cast members, and Ritter returning, while a Punisher-centered Marvel Studios Special Presentation television special starring Bernthal is in development.

Action 1: Search[Mary Poppins book series]
Observation 1: Mary Poppins is a series of eight children's books written by Australian-British writer P. L. Travers and published over the period 1934 to 1988. Mary Shepard was the illustrator throughout the series. The series began with Mary Poppins in 1934.The books centre on the magical English nanny Mary Poppins, who is blown by the East wind to Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, London, and into the Banks household to care for their children. Encounters with pavement-painters and shopkeepers, and various adventures ensue, until Mary Poppins abruptly leaves, i.e., "pops out". Only the first three of the eight books feature Mary Poppins arriving and leaving. The later five books recount previously unrecorded adventures from her original three visits. As Travers explains in her introduction to Mary Poppins in the Park, "She cannot forever arrive and depart."The books were adapted by Walt Disney into a musical film titled Mary Poppins (1964), starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. The film Saving Mr. Banks (2013) depicted the making of the 1964 film. Disney's sequel to the 1964 film, Mary Poppins Returns, was released in 2018, and stars Emily Blunt as Poppins. In 2004, Disney Theatrical in collaboration with Sir Cameron Mackintosh (who had previously acquired the stage rights from Travers) produced a stage musical also called Mary Poppins in London's West End theatre. The stage musical was transferred to Broadway, in New York, in 2006, where it ran until its closing on 3 March 2013.

The civilian death toll was about six to 13 million. The Triple Entente (also known as the Allies) lost about six million military personnel while the Central Powers lost about four million. At least two million died from diseases and six million went missing, presumed dead. This article lists the casualties of the belligerent powers based on official published sources.About two-thirds of military deaths in World War I were in battle, unlike the conflicts that took place in the 19th century when most deaths were from disease.

Observation 5: World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history. An estimated total of 70–85 million deaths were caused by the conflict, representing about 3% of the estimated global population of 2.3 billion in 1940. Deaths directly caused by the war (including military and civilian fatalities) are estimated at 50–56 million, with an additional estimated 19–28 million deaths from war-related disease and famine. Civilian deaths totaled 50–55 million. Military deaths from all causes totaled 21–25 million, including deaths in captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war. More than half of the total number of casualties are accounted for by the dead of the Republic of China and of the Soviet Union. The following tables give a detailed country-by-country count of human losses. Recent historical scholarship has shed new light on the topic of Second World War casualties. Research in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union has caused a revision of estimates of Soviet World War II fatalities. According to Russian government figures, USSR losses within postwar borders now stand at 26.6 million, including 8 to 9 million due to famine and disease. In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland's dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million. Historian Rüdiger Overmans of the Military History Research Office (Germany) published a study in 2000 estimating the German military dead and missing at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders, in Austria, and in east-central Europe. The Red Army claimed responsibility for the majority of Wehrmacht casualties during World War II. The People's Republic of China puts its war dead at 20 million, while the Japanese government puts its casualties due to the war at 3.1 million. An estimated 7–10 million people died in the Dutch, British, French and US colonies in South and Southeast Asia, mostly from war-related famine.

- Diagnosis: The previous reasoning trial was unsuccessful because I was unable to find the specific gospel singer that David Huntsinger has worked with, who was born in the month of July. I searched for "David Huntsinger" and found information about his career as a pianist and arranger, but did not find any mention of a gospel singer he has worked with. I then tried searching for "gospel singer born in July" but could not find the specific person. New Plan: To answer this question, I will take the following steps:1. Search for "David Huntsinger gospel singer" to try to find information about a specific gospel singer he has worked with.2. If that does not yield the answer, I will search for "David Huntsinger collaborations" or "David Huntsinger discography" to try to find a list of artists he has worked with.3. Once I have identified a gospel singer that David Huntsinger has worked with, I will search for that singer's birthdate to see if they were born in July.4.

The searches for "David Huntsinger gospel singer" and "gospel singer born in July" did not yield the necessary details to identify the gospel singer that David Huntsinger has worked with.New Plan:1. Search for more information on David Huntsinger's musical collaborations and the gospel singers he has worked with.2. Search for a list of notable gospel singers and their birth months to try to find one born in July that may have collaborated with David Huntsinger.3. Combine the information from the two searches to see if I can identify the specific gospel singer mentioned in the question.4. If I am still unable to find the answer, I will acknowledge the limitations in my knowledge and suggest further research steps that could be taken.

Thought 3: I apologize, but I do not have enough information to definitively answer the question of which gospel singer that David Huntsinger has worked with was born in the month of July. The searches I performed did not yield the specific details needed to identify that gospel singer. To answer this question, I would need to find more comprehensive information on David Huntsinger's musical collaborations, particularly with gospel artists. I could try searching for things like "David Huntsinger discography", "David Huntsinger gospel collaborations", or even searching for lists of notable gospel singers and their birth months. However, without being able to directly find the name of the gospel singer born in July that Huntsinger has worked with, I do not have enough confidence to provide a definitive answer. I apologize that I could not fully solve this query, but I hope I have provided a clear explanation of the limitations in my current knowledge and a plan for how I could potentially find the answer with further research. Please let me know if you have any other suggestions for how I could approach this question.

- Apologies, my previous attempt to answer the question was incorrect. Let me re-evaluate the problem and devise a new plan.Diagnosis: The key issue in my previous attempt was that I did not fully understand the context and relationship between the "chicken dance" and the original dance it is derived from.

- Apologies, I was unable to correctly answer the previous question about the chicken dance. Here is my diagnosis and a new plan:Diagnosis: The main reason for my failure was that I did not fully understand the relationship between the chicken dance and the polka dance. While I was able to find information about the chicken dance itself, I did not clearly establish how it relates to or is derived from the polka dance. I made an assumption that the chicken dance is a "change of pace" of the polka, but I did not have strong evidence to support that claim.New Plan: To better answer this question, I will take the following steps:1. Search for more information on the origins and history of the chicken dance, specifically looking for any connections or relationships to the polka dance.

In the first trial, I should have searched for each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols and looked up details on their deaths, rather than just focusing on Mussolini. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific 2004 film "The Prince & Me", when I should have explored the similar results that had a similar name and were made in 2004.

Observation 1: Lygodium (climbing fern) is a genus of about 40 species of ferns, native to tropical regions across the world, with a few temperate species in eastern Asia and eastern North America. It is the sole genus in the family Lygodiaceae  in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Alternatively, the genus may be placed as the only genus in the subfamily Lygodioideae of a more broadly defined family Schizaeaceae, the family placement used in Plants of the World Online as of November 2019. Per recent molecular evidence, Lygodiaceae is thought to have diverged relatively early from the other members of the Schizaeales due to the relatively high level of synonymous sequence divergence between the families within the Schizaeales.

The 12 man ski team under Capt. Littlejohn, and their equipment were widely scattered in the drop, and thereafter found themselves among hostile locals of essentially German origin. Their mission was to block by landslide the main rail lines through the Brenner Pass, thus having a dramatic effect on German reinforcements moving south.The men spent most of their time in hiding and attempts to supply and reinforce by air were unsuccessful.

The unit specialises in a number of roles including counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, direct action and special reconnaissance. Much of the information about the SAS is highly classified, and the unit is not commented on by either the British government or the Ministry of Defence due to the secrecy and sensitivity of its operations.The corps consists of the 22 Special Air Service Regiment, which is the regular component, as well as the 21 Special Air Service Regiment (Artists) (Reserve) and the 23 Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve), which are reserve units, all under the operational command of United Kingdom Special Forces (UKSF). Its sister unit is the Royal Navy's Special Boat Service, which specialises in maritime counter-terrorism. Both units are under the operational control of the Director Special Forces.The Special Air Service traces its origins to 1941 during the Second World War. It was reformed as part of the Territorial Army in 1947, named the 21st Special Air Service Regiment (Artists Rifles). The 22nd Special Air Service Regiment, which is part of the regular army, gained fame and recognition worldwide after its televised rescue of all but two of the hostages held during the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege.

She was defeated in the general election by the Republican candidate, businessman Donald Trump.Clinton announced her candidacy on April 12, 2015. Her main competitor in the Democratic primaries was Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran as a more progressive candidate in the primary. Clinton became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party on June 6, 2016, having received the required number of delegates. On July 22, she announced Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate, and the two were formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 26.Clinton received the most support from middle aged and older voters, as well as from African-American, Latino, and older female voters. She focused her platform on several issues, including expanding racial, LGBTQ, and women's rights; raising wages and ensuring equal pay for women; and improving healthcare. Clinton lost the general election to Republican Donald Trump on November 9, 2016; she conceded the following day. Clinton's narrow, unprecedented losses in the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin were considered key to her defeat. These states all had swings from voters who had previously voted for Obama yet went for Trump in 2016. These states have largely rely on manufacturing and part Trump’s campaign appeal was that he would end international trade agreements that hurt American manufacturing. He was outspoken on trade issues.[1]  Had Clinton been elected, she would have been the first female and first spouse of a president to serve as president of the United States, whereas her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, would also have been the first acting first lady since Margaret Woodrow Wilson.

Observation 1: W. H. Shipman House is a historic home used by William Herbert Shipman.  It is located at 141 Kaʻiulani Street, named for Princess Kaʻiulani, the last crown princess of the Kingdom and Liliʻuokalani's niece.In 1856 King Kamehameha IV leased an area known as Kolo iki to William Reed for cattle pasture. In 1861 Reed purchased the 26 acres (11 ha) and it came to be known as "Reed's Island". It is not really an island, but the area between a current and ancient channel of the Wailuku River.J. R. "Jack" Wilson owned Volcano Stables, a horse rental business at the current site of the historic Volcano Block Building in Hilo. In 1899 after an iron bridge was completed, Wilson bought a 8-acre (3.2 ha) lot with a view on Reed's island and built a large house in the Victorian architecture style. It was designed by Honolulu architect Henry Livingston Kerr, and constructed with indoor plumbing and electricity. In addition to the main house placed prominently on a hill the estate includes a guest house, servants' quarters, gardens, and a garage. An unusual feature is the two-story round tower with conical roof, circular veranda, and large curved panes of glass.In February 1901 William Shipman bought the house to entertain guests in the growing city of Hilo.Deposed Queen Liliʻuokalani would play her compositions at the grand piano when she was visiting.Author Jack London and his wife stayed at this house for five weeks in August and September 1907, while his boat The Snark was being repaired. London's book The Cruise of the Snark (1911) is based on this journey. In the early 1930s, Cecil B. DeMille filmed Four Frightened People in the gulch below the house, as well as on the Shipman land in Puna. In 1939 artist Georgia O'Keeffe stayed and was shown various sites that appeared in her paintings.The Hilo house was listed on the state register of historic places on December 5, 1973, as site 10-35-7405, and the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on June 23, 1978, as site 78001013.Barbara-Ann Andersen (daughter of Roy Shipman Blackshear, a great-granddaughter of W. H. Shipman) restored the house and operated it for roughly 20 years starting in 1997 as a bed and breakfast hotel.

- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trial was that I was unable to find the specific information needed to answer the question. I searched for general information about Operation Cold Comfort and special forces units, but did not find the key detail about the year the special forces unit involved in that operation was founded.New Plan: To answer this question, I will need to take a more targeted approach:1. Search for more details on Operation Cold Comfort, specifically trying to identify the special forces unit that carried it out.2. Once I have identified the special forces unit, I will search for information on when that unit was founded.3. With that information, I should be able to provide a final answer to the question.The key will be focusing my searches on finding the specific details needed to answer the question, rather than just general information about the topic.

Action 2: Search[Special Air Service]
Observation 2: The Special Air Service (SAS) is a special forces unit of the British Army. It was founded as a regiment in 1941 by David Stirling, and in 1950 it was reconstituted as a corps. The unit specialises in a number of roles including counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, direct action and special reconnaissance. Much of the information about the SAS is highly classified, and the unit is not commented on by either the British government or the Ministry of Defence due to the secrecy and sensitivity of its operations.The corps consists of the 22 Special Air Service Regiment, which is the regular component, as well as the 21 Special Air Service Regiment (Artists) (Reserve) and the 23 Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve), which are reserve units, all under the operational command of United Kingdom Special Forces (UKSF). Its sister unit is the Royal Navy's Special Boat Service, which specialises in maritime counter-terrorism. Both units are under the operational control of the Director Special Forces.The Special Air Service traces its origins to 1941 during the Second World War. It was reformed as part of the Territorial Army in 1947, named the 21st Special Air Service Regiment (Artists Rifles). The 22nd Special Air Service Regiment, which is part of the regular army, gained fame and recognition worldwide after its televised rescue of all but two of the hostages held during the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege.

Thought 2: Search[League of Nations]
Action 2: Search[League of Nations]
Observation 2: The League of Nations (LN or LoN; French: Société des Nations [sɔsjete de nɑsjɔ̃], SdN) was the first worldwide intergovernmental organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. It was founded on 10 January 1920 by the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War. The main organisation ceased operations on 18 April 1946 when many of its components were relocated into the new United Nations (UN) which was created in the aftermath of the Second World War.The League's primary goals were stated in its eponymous Covenant. They included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Its other concerns included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe. The Covenant of the League of Nations was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, and it became effective with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920. Australia was granted the right to participate as an autonomous member nation, marking the start of Australian independence on the global stage. The first meeting of the Council of the League took place on 16 January 1920, and the first meeting of the Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920. In 1919, U.S. president Woodrow Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role as the leading architect of the League. Despite this, he was ultimately unsuccessful in getting his country to join it.The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious Allied Powers of World War I (Britain, France, Italy and Japan were the initial permanent members of the Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement medical tents, Benito Mussolini responded that "the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out."At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. After some notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. Its credibility was weakened because the United States never joined. Japan and Germany left in 1933, Italy left in 1937, and Spain left in 1939. The Soviet Union only joined in 1934 and was expelled in 1939 after invading Finland. Furthermore, the League demonstrated an irresolute approach to sanction enforcement for fear it might only spark further conflict, further decreasing its credibility. One example of this hesitancy was the Abyssinia Crisis, in which Italy's sanctions were only limited from the outset (coal and oil were not restricted), and later altogether abandoned despite Italy being declared the aggressors in the conflict. The onset of the Second World War in 1939 showed that the League had failed its primary purpose: to prevent another world war. It was largely inactive until its abolition. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations effectively replaced it in 1945, inheriting several agencies and organisations founded by the League, with the League itself formally dissolving the following year.Current scholarly consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its main goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, gave a voice to smaller nations; fostered economic stabilisation and financial stability, especially in Central Europe in the 1920s; helped to raise awareness of problems such as epidemics, slavery, child labour, colonial tyranny, refugee crises and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation. Professor David Kennedy portrays the League as a unique moment when international affairs were "institutionalised", as opposed to the pre–First World War methods of law and politics.

Question: Otterington railway station was on a 393 mi major railway that linked Edinburgh to what city?
Thought 1: Search[Otterington railway station]
Action 1: Search[Otterington railway station]
Observation 1: Otterington railway station was located in the village of South Otterington, North Yorkshire, on the East Coast Main Line. It opened in 1841 and closed in 1958. The station is now a private residence, though the platform can still be seen. The buildings date from the 1930s when the East Coast Main Line was widened.The station became a listed building in 2018.
Thought 2: Search[East Coast Main Line]
Action 2: Search[East Coast Main Line]
Observation 2: The East Coast Main Line (ECML) is a 393-mile-long (632 km) electrified railway between its northern terminus at Edinburgh Waverley and southern terminus at London King's Cross.  Peterborough, Doncaster, York, Darlington, Durham and Newcastle are on the line, which is a key transport artery on the eastern side of Great Britain running broadly parallel to the A1 road. The main line acts as a 'spine' for several diverging branches, serving destinations such as Cambridge, Leeds, Hull, Sunderland and Lincoln, all with direct services to London. In addition, a few ECML services extend beyond Edinburgh to serve other Scottish destinations, such as Stirling, Inverness, Dundee, or Aberdeen.The line was built during the 1840s by three railway companies, the North British Railway, the North Eastern Railway, and the Great Northern Railway. In 1923, the Railways Act 1921 led to their amalgamation to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the line became its primary route. The LNER competed with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) for long-distance passenger traffic between London and Scotland. The LNER's chief mechanical engineer Nigel Gresley designed iconic Pacific steam locomotives including Flying Scotsman and Mallard, the latter of which achieved a world record speed for a steam locomotive, 126 mph (203 km/h) on the Grantham-to-Peterborough section on 3 July 1938.In 1948, the railways were nationalised and operated by British Railways. In the early 1960s, steam was replaced by diesel-electric traction, including the Deltics, and sections of the line were upgraded so that trains could run at speeds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h). With the demand for higher speed, British Rail introduced InterCity 125 high-speed trains between 1976 and 1981. In 1973, a Class 41 (an HST prototype) achieved a top speed of 143 mph (230 km/h) in a test run. In the 1980s, the line was electrified and InterCity 225 trains introduced. These have in turn been largely replaced by Class 800 and Class 801 units. The November 2021 Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands stated that the linespeed would be upgraded to 140 mph (225 km/h).The line links London, South East England, East Anglia and the East Midlands, with Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland, and is important to their local economies. It carries commuter traffic in north London as well as cross-country, commuter and local passenger services, and freight. In 1997, operations were privatised. The primary long-distance operator is London North Eastern Railway, but open-access competition on services to Northern England and Scotland is provided by Hull Trains, Grand Central and Lumo.
Thought 3: Based on the information provided, the Otterington railway station was located on the East Coast Main Line, which is a 393-mile railway line that links Edinburgh to London King's Cross. Therefore, the city that the East Coast Main Line linked Edinburgh to is London.

Observation 2: Clara Ann Fowler (November 8, 1927 – January 1, 2013), better known by her stage name Patti Page, was an American singer. Primarily known for pop and country music, she was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six-decade-long career. She was often introduced as "the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page". New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as "A Page in my life called Patti".Page signed with Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948's "Confess". In 1950, she had her first million-selling single "With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming", and eventually had 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965.Page's signature song, "Tennessee Waltz", is the best selling song of the 1950s by a female artist, one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is recognized today as one of the official songs of the state of Tennessee.

Page had three additional number-one hit singles between 1950 and 1953, "All My Love (Bolero)", "I Went to Your Wedding", and "(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?".Unlike most other pop singers, Page blended country music styles into many of her songs. As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page's singles appeared on the Billboard Country Chart. In the 1970s, she shifted her style more toward country music and began having even more success on the country charts, ending up as one of the few vocalists to have charted in five separate decades.With the rise of rock and roll in the 1950s, mainstream popular music record sales began to decline. Page was among the few pop singers who were able to maintain popularity, continuing to have hits well into the 1960s, with "Old Cape Cod", "Allegheny Moon", "A Poor Man's Roses (or a Rich Man's Gold)", and "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte".In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. She was posthumously honored with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2013.

Thought 1: Search[Ruggero Deodato]
Action 1: Search[Ruggero Deodato]
Observation 1: Ruggero Deodato (Italian pronunciation: [rudˈdʒɛːro de.oˈda.to]; 7 May 1939 – 29 December 2022) was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and actor.His career spanned a wide-range of genres including peplum, comedy, drama, poliziottesco, and science fiction, yet he is perhaps best known for directing violent and gory horror films with strong elements of realism. His most notable film is Cannibal Holocaust, considered one of the most controversial and brutal in the history of cinema, which was seized, banned or heavily censored in many countries, and which contained special effects so realistic that they led to Deodato being arrested on suspicion of murder. Cannibal Holocaust is also cited as a precursor of found footage films such as The Blair Witch Project and The Last Broadcast. The film strengthened Deodato's fame as an "extreme" director and earned him the nickname "Monsieur Cannibal" in France.Deodato was an influence on film directors like Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth and Nicolas Winding Refn.

Observation 2: The New York and New Jersey campaign in 1776 and the winter months of 1777 was a series of American Revolutionary War battles for control of the Port of New York and the state of New Jersey, fought between British forces under General Sir William Howe and the Continental Army under General George Washington.  Howe was successful in driving Washington out of New York, but overextended his reach into New Jersey, and ended the New York and New Jersey campaign in January 1777 with only a few outposts near New York City under British control. The British held New York Harbor for the rest of the Revolutionary War, using it as a base for expeditions against other targets.Landing unopposed on Staten Island on July 3, 1776, Howe had assembled an army that included components that had withdrawn from Boston in March following the British failure to hold that city, combined with additional British troops, and Hessian troops hired from several German principalities. Washington's Continental Army included New England soldiers and regiments from the Thirteen Colonies as far south as the Colony of Virginia. Landing on Long Island in August, Howe defeated Washington in the largest battle of the war in North America, but the Continental Army was able to regroup and make an orderly and covert retreat to Manhattan that night under a cover of darkness and fog. Washington suffered a series of further defeats in Manhattan but prevailed in a skirmish at the Battle of Harlem Heights and eventually withdrew his troops successfully to White Plains, New York. Howe, meanwhile, returned to Manhattan and captured those forces Washington had left on the island.Washington and much of his army crossed the Hudson River to Rockland County and then south into New Jersey, retreated across the state, and then crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. Along the way, his army shrank due to the ending of enlistment periods, desertions, and poor morale. Howe ordered his troops into winter quarters in December, establishing a chain of outposts from New York City to Burlington, New Jersey.  Washington, in a tremendous boost to American morale, launched a successful strike against the Trenton garrison on the morning of December 26, 1776, prompting Howe to withdraw his chain of outposts back to New Brunswick and the coast near New York. Washington, in turn, established his winter camp at Morristown.  During the following winter months and through the rest of the war, both sides skirmished frequently around New York City and New Jersey as the British sought forage and provisions.Britain maintained control of New York City and some of the surrounding territory until the war ended in 1783, using it as a base for operations elsewhere in North America.  In 1777, General Howe launched a campaign to capture the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia, leaving General Sir Henry Clinton in command of the New York area, while General John Burgoyne led an attempt to gain control of the Hudson River valley, moving south from Quebec and being defeated at Saratoga.

Observation 2: The Dark Tower is a series of eight novels, one novella, and a children's book written by American author Stephen King. Incorporating themes from multiple genres, including dark fantasy, science fantasy, horror, and Western, it describes a "gunslinger" and his quest toward a tower, the nature of which is both physical and metaphorical. The series, and its use of the Dark Tower, expands upon Stephen King's multiverse and in doing so, links together many of his other novels.In addition to the eight novels of the series proper that comprise 4,250 pages, many of King's other books relate to the story, introducing concepts and characters that come into play as the series progresses.The series was chiefly inspired by the poem "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came" by Robert Browning, the full text of which was included in the final volume's appendix. In the preface to the revised 2003 edition of The Gunslinger, King also identifies The Lord of the Rings, Arthurian legend, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as inspirations. He identifies Clint Eastwood's "Man with No Name" character as one of the major inspirations for the protagonist, Roland Deschain. King's style of location names in the series, such as Mid-World, and his development of a unique language (High Speech), are also influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien's work.A film based on Stephen King's novel series was released in August 2017.

Observation 5: Marvel's Netflix television series are a set of interconnected American television series created for the streaming service Netflix, based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. Produced by Marvel Television and ABC Studios, they are set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the franchise's films and other television series. Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb revealed the group of shows were known internally as the "Marvel Street-Level Heroes" or "Marvel Knights" series.A deal between Marvel and Netflix to produce several interconnected series was announced in November 2013, with the individual series Daredevil (2015–2018), Jessica Jones (2015–2019), Luke Cage (2016–2018), and Iron Fist (2017–2018) culminating in the crossover miniseries The Defenders (2017). A spin-off from Daredevil, The Punisher (2017–2019), was ordered in April 2016. The series were all filmed in New York State, forming the state's largest television production commitment across 161 episodes. They star Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones, Mike Colter as Luke Cage, and Finn Jones as Danny Rand / Iron Fist, who all star together in The Defenders, as well as Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher. Many actors have roles across the different series, including Rosario Dawson who signed a special deal to portray Claire Temple.The series are believed to have generated strong viewership for Netflix, who do not release exact viewership details, and received positive reviews for their casts and darker take on the MCU. There were some common criticisms of the series, such as for their pacing. Netflix had cancelled all of the series by February 2019, when Marvel's parent company Disney was preparing its own streaming service, Disney+. The series were all removed from Netflix on March 1, 2022, after Disney regained the licenses for them, and they began streaming on Disney+ from March 16, where they were collected under the title "The Defenders Saga".Contractually, Marvel had to wait two years before they could use the characters without Netflix. Vincent D'Onofrio and Cox were the first actors to reprise their roles in Marvel Studios-produced MCU projects, in December 2021. A new Daredevil series, titled Daredevil: Born Again, premiered in 2025 on Disney+, with Cox, D'Onofrio, Bernthal, other Daredevil cast members, and Ritter returning, while a Punisher-centered Marvel Studios Special Presentation television special starring Bernthal is in development.

Action 1: Search[Oneida Community]
Observation 1: The Oneida Community ( oh-NYE-də) was a perfectionist religious communal society founded by John Humphrey Noyes and his followers in 1848 near Oneida, New York. The community believed that Jesus had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about Jesus's millennial kingdom themselves, and be perfect and free of sin in this world, not just in Heaven (a belief called perfectionism). The Oneida Community practiced communalism (in the sense of communal property and possessions), group marriage, male sexual continence, Oneida stirpiculture (a form of eugenics), and mutual criticism.The community's original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878. There were smaller Noyesian communities in Wallingford, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; Putney and Cambridge, Vermont. The branches were closed in 1854 except for the Wallingford branch, which operated until the 1878 tornado devastated it.The Oneida Community dissolved in 1881, converting itself to a joint-stock company. This eventually became the silverware company Oneida Limited, one of the largest in the world.

Question: Where was the first governor after the The Missouri Compromise from?
Thought 1: Search[Missouri Compromise]
Action 1: Search[Missouri Compromise]
Observation 1: The Missouri Compromise (also known as the Compromise of 1820) was federal legislation of the United States that balanced the desires of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it. It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. While the slave states earlier claimed Federal protection for slavery, they now objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and claimed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana Purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. "[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality." "The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states."When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise provision that banned slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was controversial.  While it mollified most people at the time and settled the issue for more than 20 years, many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along regional and sectarian lines.  Tensions resumed in the 1840s and the Compromise of 1850 only briefly defused the situation. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.

Observation 2: Engelbert Dollfuss (alternatively Dollfuß; 4 October 1892 – 25 July 1934) was an Austrian politician and dictator who served as chancellor of Austria between 1932 and 1934. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative and nationalist government. This crisis culminated in the self-elimination of the Austrian Parliament, a coup sparked by the resignation of the presiding officers of the National Council. Suppressing the Socialist movement in the Austrian Civil War and later banning the Austrian Nazi Party, he cemented his rule through the First of May Constitution in 1934. Later that year, Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitler's Anschluss in 1938.

He meets a gorgeous young man online, a devotee (devoteeism (or acrotomophilia) is the sexual attraction to people with amputations) who seems like he might be different. Their encounter proves Hervé’s difficulty in finding a true connection with someone who is interested in treating him like a person rather than a mere fetish." Devotee was DVD released on the US in 2009.Lange's fifth feature, Partir, the story of a young Tunisian boy going to France to shoot an underground movie, was released on DVD in France in August 2009.

A collaboration between game designer Goichi Suda (also known by his nickname Suda51) and filmmaker James Gunn, the game was published in Japan by Kadokawa Games and internationally by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Lollipop Chainsaw features Juliet Starling (voiced by Tara Strong in English and by both Eri Kitamura in the Xbox 360 version and Yoko Hikasa in the PlayStation 3 version in Japanese—with limited uncensored versions allowing the player to change between the two voices after completing the game once), a cheerleader zombie hunter fighting zombies in a fictional California high school. Lollipop Chainsaw was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in June 2012. The game’s reception was divided. Japanese critics praised the games’ combo centered gameplay and the satirical storyline, while Western critics felt that the game’s repetitious gameplay and crude storyline were detracting factors. Nonetheless, the game garnered a cult following and was a commercial success, selling over 1.24 million units by June 2024.A remaster titled Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S in September 2024, with versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One released in December 2024.

Question: This expansion of the 2008 magazine article "Is Google Making Us Stoopid?" was a finalist for what award?
Thought 1: Search[Is Google Making Us Stoopid?]
Action 1: Search[Is Google Making Us Stoopid?]
Observation 1: Is Google Making Us Stupid? What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains! (alternatively Is Google Making Us Stoopid?) is a magazine article by technology writer Nicholas G. Carr, and is highly critical of the Internet's effect on cognition. It was published in the July/August 2008 edition of The Atlantic magazine as a six-page cover story. Carr's main argument is that the Internet might have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation. Despite the title, the article is not specifically targeted at Google, but more at the cognitive impact of the Internet and World Wide Web. Carr expanded his argument in The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains, a book published by W. W. Norton in June 2010.The essay was extensively discussed in the media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.While long-term psychological and neurological studies have yet to yield definitive results justifying Carr's argument, a few studies have provided glimpses into the changing cognitive habits of Internet users. A UCLA study led some to wonder whether a breadth of brain activity—which was shown to occur while users performed Internet searches in the study's functional MRI scans—actually facilitated reading and cognition or possibly overburdened the mind; and what quality of thought could be determined by the additional presence of brain activity in regions known to control decision-making and complex reasoning skills.
Thought 2: The passage does not mention anything about the expansion of the 2008 magazine article "Is Google Making Us Stoopid?" being a finalist for an award. The passage focuses on providing background information on the original article and the subsequent book "The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains", but does not discuss any awards or recognition received by the book or the article's expansion. Without any information about an award the expanded work was a finalist for, I do not have enough information to answer the question.

Observation 1: The Chronicle of Philanthropy is a magazine and digital platform that covers the nonprofit world of philanthropy. Based in Washington, D.C., it is aimed at charity leaders, foundation executives, fund raisers, and other people involved in philanthropy. The Chronicle of Philanthropy publishes 12 print issues a year as well as daily Web coverage and multiple e-newsletters, including Philanthropy Today.The Chronicle of Philanthropy was founded in 1988 by editor Phil Semas and then managing editor Stacy Palmer. It was initially owned by The Chronicle of Higher Education Inc., which also publishes The Chronicle of Higher Education, a weekly newspaper covering colleges and universities.

Thought 2: Search[Antic]
Action 2: Search[Antic]
Observation 2: An attic (sometimes referred to as a loft) is a space found directly below the pitched roof of a house or other building. It is also known as a sky parlor or a garret. Because they fill the space between the ceiling of a building's top floor and its slanted roof, attics are known for being awkwardly-shaped spaces with difficult-to-reach corners and often exposed rafters.While some attics are converted into bedrooms, home offices, or attic apartments complete with windows and staircases, most remain difficult to access, and are usually entered using a loft hatch and ladder. Attics help control temperatures in a house by providing a large mass of slowly moving air, and are often used for storage. The hot air rising from the lower floors of a building is often retained in attics, further compounding their reputation as inhospitable environments. However, in recent years, they have been insulated to help decrease heating costs, since uninsulated attics account for 15% of the energy loss in average houses.A loft  or mezzanine is also the uppermost space in a building, but is distinguished from an attic in that an attic typically constitutes an entire floor of the building, while a loft or mezzanine covers only a few rooms, leaving one or more sides open to the lower floor.Attics are found in many different shapes and sizes. They also have many uses: In residential buildings, they are either small unusable spaces filled with insulation, or spaces with storage or HVAC equipment. Some commercial buildings also have attics under pitched roofs that are usually used for storage, mechanical equipment, or for roof access.
Thought 3: The information provided does not indicate any overlap in the publishing timelines of The Chronicle of Philanthropy and Antic. The Chronicle of Philanthropy was founded in 1988, while Antic appears to be a magazine about attics and lofts, not a publication. Without any information about when Antic was published, I cannot determine if there was any overlap with The Chronicle of Philanthropy. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the question.

Thought 2: Search[Shape magazine]
Action 2: Search[Shape magazine]
Observation 2: Shape (stylized in all caps) is an American monthly fitness magazine started by Weider Publications in 1981, founded by Christine MacIntyre (a pioneer in women's free weight fitness) and became the number one women's fitness magazine. At that time, Weider Enterprises consisted primarily of the bodybuilding magazine Muscle & Fitness. Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present Shape, Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine. Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy. MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided. Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1987. Weider was purchased by American Media in 2002. A German version of Shape is available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The magazine is also edited in Romania.Elizabeth Goodman Artis was named Editor-in-Chief in 2014 and held the position until 2021.On January 28, 2015, it was reported that Shape would be acquired by Meredith Corp. and Fitness, published by the company, would cease publication in May 2015 and be combined with it.
Thought 3: Finish[Velvetpark is written more for a lesbian and queer-identified female readership]Based on the information provided:- Velvetpark is described as a "lesbian and feminist arts and culture American website" that "regularly features music, literature, theater, fine arts, film, television, and social activism as it impacts queer culture." It also hosts a "social network and dating community for lesbians and queer-identified women."- In contrast, Shape magazine is described as a general women's fitness magazine, founded with the goal of presenting a "healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy." There is no indication that it is specifically targeted towards lesbian or queer-identified readers.Therefore, the evidence suggests that Velvetpark is written more for a lesbian and queer-identified female readership compared to Shape magazine.

Observation 1: Bhaavageete or Bhavageeth (literally 'emotion poetry') is a form of poetry and pop music in India. Most of the poetry sung in this genre pertains to subjects like love, nature, and philosophy, and the genre itself is not much different from ghazals, though ghazals are bound to a peculiar metre. This genre is quite popular in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. This genre may be called by different names in other languages. In Telugu, they are known as Bhava Geethaalu. Cherukuri Ramarao is one of the popular writers of Bhava Geethaalu in Telugu.

- Diagnosis: The main issue in the previous trial was that I was unable to find the specific information needed to answer the question. I searched for the movie "Grown-Ups" and the TV show "'Allo 'Allo!", but could not find the connection between an actor from "'Allo 'Allo!" appearing in "Grown-Ups".

- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find the specific information required to answer the questions. In the first trial, I was able to find information about the Rome Protocols and the Prime Ministers involved, but I did not search for details on how one of the Prime Ministers was assassinated. In the second trial, I was unable to find the specific 2004 film "The Prince and Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, and the director of that film. In the third trial, I could not find any information about the movie "Grown-Ups" and the actor from "'Allo 'Allo!" who starred in it.New Plan: To mitigate these failures, I will adopt a more systematic and thorough approach to searching for information. Instead of just searching for broad terms, I will try to break down the questions into more specific search queries, and follow up on any leads or related information that comes up. I will also be more careful about verifying that I have found the exact information required to answer the question, rather than making assumptions or guesses.

- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find the specific information needed to answer the question. The key issues were:1. In the first trial, I should have searched for more details on each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols, rather than just focusing on Mussolini. This would have allowed me to identify the one who was assassinated as part of World War II.2. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to search for the exact title "The Prince & Me (2004 film)", when I should have tried searching for similar titles or the broader "The Prince and Me" franchise. This prevented me from finding the director information.3. In the third trial, I was unable to find any information about the movie "Grown-Ups" that the question was referring to, as well as the specific actor from "'Allo 'Allo!" who appeared in it.

Interscope's first hit records arrived in under a year, and it achieved profitability in 1993. Chair and CEO until May 2014, Iovine was succeeded by John Janick.In 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive rights to market and distribute releases from hardcore hip hop label Death Row Records, a decision that ultimately put the label at the center of the mid-1990s gangsta rap controversy. As a result, Time Warner, then the parent of Warner Music Group, severed ties with Interscope by selling its 50 percent stake back to Field and Iovine for $115 million in 1995.

Observation 1: Beer Wars is a 2009 documentary film about the American beer industry. In particular, it covers the differences between large corporate breweries, namely Anheuser-Busch, the Miller Brewing Company, and the Coors Brewing Company opposed to smaller breweries like Dogfish Head Brewery, Moonshot 69, Yuengling, Stone Brewing Co., and other producers of craft beer. Also covered is how advertising and lobbyists are used to control the beer market, implying that these things harm competition and consumer choice.Throughout the film, there is a theme that the smallest breweries have next to no chance to compete due to the sheer volume of advertising and outdated beer distribution laws. The original laws demanded a three-tier system to separate the powers of selling beer. The law demands that the beer brewer cannot deliver directly to the retailer, supposedly creating a separation of powers resembling the US government's legislative, judicial, and executive branches. The film claims these laws are now inhibiting growth of smaller brewers and therefore allowing the largest brewers (Coors, Anheuser-Busch, and Miller) to maintain an oligopoly on beer.The film was written, produced, narrated, and directed by Anat Baron, former head of Mike's Hard Lemonade.

The company's best known brand is Arrogant Bastard Ale, which has been described as a "watershed beer" that "put San Diego on the craft brew map." Most of Stone's beers are characteristic of west-coast craft beer, meaning that they have a high hop content, and an average alcohol strength between 6% and 10%.Stone Brewing has been rated as a "world class brewery" by two beer enthusiast websites, RateBeer and BeerAdvocate. Stone Brewing has been voted by the readers of Beer Advocate as the #1 "All Time Top Brewery on Planet Earth."In August 2022, Sapporo Breweries bought Stone for $165 million, with the Stone brewery taking on production of Sapporo beers in California for distribution across North America.

Observation 2: Joe Frazier vs. Muhammad Ali, billed as The Fight of the Century or simply The Fight, was an undisputed heavyweight championship boxing match between WBA, WBC, and The Ring heavyweight champion Joe Frazier and Lineal champion  Muhammad Ali, on Monday, March 8, 1971, at Madison Square Garden in New York City.The fight is widely regarded as the biggest boxing match in history and arguably the single most anticipated and publicized sporting event of all time. An international audience observed the spectacle. It was the first time that two undefeated boxers who held or had held the world heavyweight title fought each other for that very title.The bout held broad appeal for many Americans, including non-boxing and non-sport fans. Ali, who had been stripped of his titles by boxing authorities for refusing to submit to the draft for the Vietnam War, had become a symbol of the anti-establishment public during his government-imposed exile from the ring. In contrast, Frazier supported U.S. involvement in the war, and he had been adopted by elements of the public with alternate views. In addition, both men possessed intense personal animosity towards each other.Frazier won in fifteen rounds by unanimous decision. Ali dealt with his first professional loss. It became the first of a trio of fights, followed by the rematch events Super Fight II (1974) and the Thrilla in Manila (1975). Both of those fights were won by Ali.

Both singles from the album also reached the top 5 of the UK and US singles charts, with "Silly Love Songs" reaching number 1 in the US.The album was recorded and released in the midst of Wings' highly successful Wings Over the World tour, with songs from the album performed on the tour after its release. Subsequently, performances of "Let 'Em In", "Time to Hide", 'Silly Love Songs' and "Beware My Love" were included on the live album Wings over America, released in December 1976.As a reaction to critics who believed Wings was merely a vehicle for Paul McCartney, the album featured every member of the band taking lead vocals on at least one song, and two songs from the album are written or co-written by band members other than the McCartneys.

You have attempted to answer following question before and failed. The following reflection(s) give a plan to avoid failing to answer the question in the same way you did previously. Use them to improve your strategy of correctly answering the given question.
Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The failure in the previous trial was due to not being able to find the specific information needed to answer the question. The search results did not contain the details about the baseball player's birth year, rookie year, and team that were specified in the question.New Plan: To answer this type of question, I will need to:1. Search for the name of the baseball player mentioned in the question.2. Carefully review the search results to find the player's birth year, rookie year, and team information.3. If I can find all the details specified in the question, I will provide the answer. 4. If I cannot find all the details, I will indicate that I am unable to determine the answer from the available information.The key is to thoroughly search for and extract the specific details required to answer the question, rather than making assumptions or guesses. By following this more systematic approach, I can improve my chances of successfully answering this type of question.
- Possible reason for failure: The search results did not provide the specific information needed to answer the question. The searches for "professional baseball player born in 1984 played as a rookie for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2007" and "Los Angeles Dodgers 2007 rookie" returned general information about the 2007 Dodgers season, but did not mention any players matching the details provided in the question.New plan:1. Search for "Los Angeles Dodgers 2007 roster" to get a list of players on the team that year.
- Diagnosis: The previous reasoning trial failed because I was unable to find the relevant information to answer the question. The search results I obtained were not related to the question being asked, as they were about the 2025 Los Angeles Dodgers season rather than a player who debuted in 2007. I did not have enough information to determine the answer.New Plan: To answer this question, I will need to search for information specifically about Los Angeles Dodgers players who debuted in 2007. I will search for terms like "Los Angeles Dodgers 2007 rookies" or "Los Angeles Dodgers 2007 roster" to try to find a list of players who joined the team that year. Then I will look for any players born in 1984 and see if I can find their name and confirm they were a rookie in 2007.

Question: Which professional baseball player was born in 1984 and played as a rookie for the Los Angeles Dogers in 2007?
Thought 1: Search[Los Angeles Dodgers 2007 roster]
Action 1: Search[Los Angeles Dodgers 2007 roster]
Observation 1: The 2025 Los Angeles Dodgers season was the 136th season for the Los Angeles Dodgers franchise in Major League Baseball (MLB), their 68th season in Los Angeles, California, and their 64th season playing their home games at Dodger Stadium. They entered the season as the defending World Series champions after winning their eighth World Series title in franchise history, and finished the season by successfully defending their title for the first time in franchise history, winning their ninth title in the 2025 World Series over the Toronto Blue Jays, 4–3.For the second year in a row, the Dodgers began the season outside of America, this time in Tokyo, Japan for the Tokyo Series. They became the first defending World Series champion to begin their season 8–0, besting the previous record held by the 1933 Yankees, who started their season 7–0. The Dodgers clinched their 13th straight post-season appearance on September 19, extending the longest streak in franchise history. On September 25, they clinched the National League West title for the fourth straight season and 12th time the last 13 years.On September 18, 3-time Cy Young winner and former MVP Clayton Kershaw announced his retirement at the conclusion of the season. The team passed 4 million in home attendance for the first time in franchise history.As the third seed, the Dodgers opened the playoffs in the Wild Card Series against the sixth seed, Cincinnati Reds. They swept the Reds in two games to advance to the NLDS. They then defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in four games and advanced to the National League Championship Series for the second year in a row. They swept the Milwaukee Brewers in four games to win their second straight NLCS and the fifth in nine years (2017–2018, 2020, 2024–2025), in a series defined by their starting pitching dominance. They defeated the Blue Jays in the World Series in seven games to become the first franchise to repeat as World Series champions since the 1998–2000 New York Yankees. The Dodgers were just the ninth team to win Games 6 and 7 on the road in a World Series. In Game 7, they were the first team in MLB history to stage a comeback on the road in the ninth inning of a winner-take-all World Series game, ultimately winning in 11 innings by a score of 5-4. Unlike last season, the Dodgers did not hold home-advantage for any of the last three rounds.
Thought 2: The search results provided information about the 2025 Los Angeles Dodgers season, which is not relevant to answering the question about a player who debuted in 2007. I do not have enough information to determine the answer. To answer this question, I will need to search for information specifically about Los Angeles Dodgers players who debuted in 2007. Some better search queries could be:

Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trial was the inability to find the specific information needed to answer the question. The searches conducted did not provide the necessary details about Maroon 5's discography and the lead vocalist for each of their studio albums.New Plan:1. Search for "Maroon 5 discography" to get an overview of their studio album releases.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find the specific information needed to answer the questions. In the first trial, I should have searched for more details on each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols, rather than just focusing on one. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the exact title of the 2004 film, when I should have tried searching for more general information about the film franchise. In the third trial, I was unable to find Maroon 5's full discography, which prevented me from determining the lead vocalist for their sixth studio album.New Plan: To mitigate these types of failures in the future, I will adopt a more systematic and comprehensive approach to information gathering. Rather than relying on a single search or piece of information, I will:1. Perform a broader initial search to get an overview of the topic, then gradually narrow down to more specific details.2.

His apparent success led to Roman invasion, nominally in support of his defeated enemies. He resisted the Romans for almost a decade, using guerrilla warfare, but when he offered a set-piece battle he was defeated by Roman forces. After defeat he fled to the territory of Queen Cartimandua, who captured him and handed him over to the Romans. He was sentenced to death but made a speech before his execution that persuaded the Emperor Claudius to spare him. Caratacus' speech to Claudius has been a popular subject in visual art.

The key issue was that the search results did not directly state the occupations of both individuals, only providing biographical details. To answer this question, I would need to find information that explicitly states the occupations they have in common. A better approach would be to search for information comparing the occupations of Ian Hunter and Rob Thomas, rather than just searching for their individual biographies. This would allow me to directly identify the overlapping occupations between the two. In the future, I will focus on finding information that directly compares the relevant attributes between the entities in the question, rather than just searching for individual profiles.

The film blends elements of various genres, such as period drama, dark comedy, psychological horror, crime, psychological thriller, romance, and fantasy.Based on the notorious Parker–Hulme murder case, Heavenly Creatures examines the relationship between two teenage girls—Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme—which culminates in the premeditated killing of Parker's mother. The story's events span the period from the girls' first meeting in 1952 to the carrying out of the crime, which took place in Christchurch, New Zealand on 22 June 1954.Heavenly Creatures debuted at the Venice Film Festival in September 1994, where it was awarded the Silver Lion. It went on to receive widespread critical acclaim, becoming one of the best-received films of that year. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production, with particular attention given to the work of the previously unknown Lynskey and Winslet, as well as Jackson's directing. The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay in 1995.

Thought 4: Okay, I'm still unable to find any information about a CD/DVD called "Here at the End of All Things" or determine the book that inspired its name. The searches so far have not yielded any relevant results. Since I don't have enough context about this specific CD/DVD, I don't think I can confidently answer the question of who wrote the book that inspired its name.

Observation 1: William Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 – March 8, 1930) was the 27th president of the United States from 1909 to 1913 and the tenth chief justice of the United States from 1921 to 1930. He is the only person to have held both offices.Taft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. His father, Alphonso Taft, was a U.S. attorney general and secretary of war. Taft attended Yale and joined Skull and Bones, of which his father was a founding member. After becoming a lawyer, Taft was appointed a judge while still in his twenties. He continued a rapid rise, being named solicitor general and a judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1901, President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and he became Roosevelt's hand-picked successor. Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice, Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, believing his political work to be more important.With Roosevelt's help, Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency in that November's election. As president, he focused on East Asia more than European affairs and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments. Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs, then a major source of governmental income, but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests. His administration was filled with conflict between the Republican Party's conservative wing, with which Taft often sympathized, and its progressive wing, toward which Roosevelt moved more and more. Controversies over conservation and antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men. The 1912 presidential election was a three-way race, as Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination. Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates and Roosevelt bolted the party. The split left Taft with little chance of reelection, and he took only Utah and Vermont in his loss to Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson.After leaving office, Taft returned to Yale as a professor, continuing his political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft chief justice, an office he had long sought. Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues, and under him there were advances in individual rights. In poor health, he resigned in February 1930, and died the following month. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there. Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.
Thought 2: The information provided in the search results is about William Howard Taft, the 27th president of the United States, and does not contain any information about a William Howard associated with a railroad. To answer this question, I would need to find information specifically about a William Howard who worked for a railroad, rather than the president. Since the current search results do not contain the relevant information, I do not have enough information to determine where the original line of the railroad that William Howard worked for was located.

Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of specific information about the key entities involved (the Rome Protocols, the 2004 film, and the Gator Country guitarist). The searches were too broad and did not provide the necessary details to answer the questions.New Plan:1. For the Rome Protocols question:   - Search for each of the three Prime Ministers (Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula Gömbös) individually to find details about their assassinations and how they were related to the Rome Protocols.   - Synthesize the information from the individual searches to determine what the Prime Ministers were assassinated as part of.2. For the Kam Heskin/Paige Morgan question:   - Search for the specific 2004 film "The Prince & Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, and find the director of that film.   - If the film title is not found, try searching for similar film titles or franchises that Kam Heskin was involved in to find the relevant 2004 film.3
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of specific information about the key details in the questions. In the first trial, I should have searched for each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols and looked up details about their deaths, rather than just focusing on Mussolini. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific 2004 film "The Prince & Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, instead of looking for similar films or franchises that may have been relevant. In the third trial, the question about a Gator Country guitarist co-writing a song called "Bloody Reunion" did not have enough contextual information for me to determine the relevant band.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will focus on the following:1. Ask clarifying questions: If a question does not provide enough specific details, I will ask the user for additional context or information that could help me better understand the key elements of the question.2. Conduct more comprehensive searches: Instead of just searching for one or two key terms, I will try to search for multiple related entities, events, or details

The search results mentioned a Southern rock band called Gator Country and a South Korean horror film called "Bloody Reunion", but there was no connection between the two or any information about a Gator Country guitarist co-writing a song called "Bloody Reunion".New Plan: To answer this question, I will need to find more specific information about the Gator Country guitarist who co-wrote a song called "Bloody Reunion". I will start by searching for "Gator Country band members" to try to identify the guitarist in question. Then I will search for information on that guitarist's musical background and previous bands they may have been a part of. Finally, I will search for information on the song "Bloody Reunion" and its co-writers to see if I can find a connection to the Gator Country guitarist.

Observation 2: Mary Poppins is a series of eight children's books written by Australian-British writer P. L. Travers and published over the period 1934 to 1988. Mary Shepard was the illustrator throughout the series. The series began with Mary Poppins in 1934.The books centre on the magical English nanny Mary Poppins, who is blown by the East wind to Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, London, and into the Banks household to care for their children. Encounters with pavement-painters and shopkeepers, and various adventures ensue, until Mary Poppins abruptly leaves, i.e., "pops out". Only the first three of the eight books feature Mary Poppins arriving and leaving. The later five books recount previously unrecorded adventures from her original three visits. As Travers explains in her introduction to Mary Poppins in the Park, "She cannot forever arrive and depart."The books were adapted by Walt Disney into a musical film titled Mary Poppins (1964), starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. The film Saving Mr. Banks (2013) depicted the making of the 1964 film. Disney's sequel to the 1964 film, Mary Poppins Returns, was released in 2018, and stars Emily Blunt as Poppins. In 2004, Disney Theatrical in collaboration with Sir Cameron Mackintosh (who had previously acquired the stage rights from Travers) produced a stage musical also called Mary Poppins in London's West End theatre. The stage musical was transferred to Broadway, in New York, in 2006, where it ran until its closing on 3 March 2013.

Without more specific information about the content and focus of the third book and final novel, I cannot confidently answer the question. To improve, I should have continued searching for more details on the later books in the series to try to find the requested information, rather than just stating what I could not determine.

- Diagnosis: The main issue in the previous trials was that I was unable to find the specific information needed to answer the questions. In the first trial, I should have searched for each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols and looked up how they died, rather than just focusing on Mussolini. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific 2004 film "The Prince & Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, when I should have tried searching for similar films from that year. And in the third trial, I could not find any information about the Livesey Hal War Memorial, so I had no way to determine which war it commemorated.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will take a more systematic approach to searching for information. Rather than jumping straight to trying to answer the question, I will first search for the key entities or events mentioned, and gather as much relevant information as possible before attempting to synthesize an answer.

Observation 2: (Result 2/2) == Notable recordings and title changes ==In 1981, Henry Hadaway produced a version of the song, which was released in the United Kingdom as an instrumental novelty tune "The Birdie Song" by The Tweets. It peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart in October 1981, making it the most popular version. A 1981 video shows bird-costumed dancers miming as instrumentalists while the recording plays and young people dance on stage. This may be the earliest recording of the dance and hand-clapping. In 2000, this version was voted "the most annoying song of all time" in a poll commissioned for the Web site dotmusic.In 1981, the Spanish accordionist María Jesus Grados Ventura, better known as María Jesús y su Acordeón, released the song as "El Baile de los Pajaritos." This version included Spanish lyrics in both the verses and refrain.In 1981, the song was recorded and released in Finland by Frederik under the name "Tralalala"In 1981 the Italian musicians Al Bano and Romina Power recorded it as "Il ballo del Qua Qua."In 1981 a French recording by René Simard and Nathalie Simard was released under the title "La Danse des Canards."In 1982, the music producer for the Milwaukee-based organist and polka composer Bob Kames first heard "Dance Little Bird" at a German music fair.  The producer sent Kames a copy, and Kames recorded his own version on the Hammond organ, as "Dance Little Bird" or "The Chicken Dance"  and released it that same year.  The Kames recording hit solid gold when it was released in 1983 in Poland, selling 300,000 copies.  Kames received 2 of the 35 cents from each sale.  Since he could not take the money out of the country, he donated all of it to for a relief fund.  The success of the song stunned Kames.  He commented in a 1995 interview, "This stupid little thing, it's infectious.  It has only two chords, it doesn't even change for the bridge.  It implants the melody in people's minds—it just sticks in there.  That's gotta be the secret ... It just keeps on going.  People come up to me at jobs and tell me how happy it makes them.  You get a song like this once in a lifetime." Kames became known as "The Chicken Dance King" and performed the song live at hundreds of festivals with fellow musicians like Lawrence Welk and Frankie Yankovic, as well as his own children, Bob Jr. and Barbara Kames.In 1982, the polka-themed cover band "The Emeralds", from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, released their version on K-Tel records. The album that included it, "Bird Dance," was advertised heavily on television, and the ad featured a bird-costumed dancer among a group performing the dance. The album went double-platinum in Canada, and gold in Australia. The song also contributed to the success of multiple gold albums for the Emeralds in 1983 and 1984.In 1984, the song was translated to Brazilian Portuguese by Edgard Poças, from children's music group Turma do Balão Mágico, and was included in the Brazilian soundtrack of Mexican TV series Chispita. In the same year, Gugu Liberato released his second compact album with the song, entitled as "Baile dos Passarinhos" ("Little Birds' Ball"), becoming an instant success in Brazil and the most famous version of the song in the country.In 1990 an electronic remix was released by the Belgian band Brussels Sound Revolution as "La Danse Des Canards / De Vogeltjesdans".In 1990, the Dutch band Grandmaster Chicken and DJ Duck released the song as "Check Out the Chicken", which peaked at number 16 in Australia.

Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find relevant information about Alan Dean Foster, which prevented me from determining the common profession shared by John Lanchester and Alan Dean Foster.New Plan:1. Search for "Alan Dean Foster" again, but this time focus on finding information about his profession, not just biographical details.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find the necessary information to answer the questions. In the first trial, I should have searched for each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols and looked up details on their deaths, rather than just focusing on Mussolini. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific 2004 film "The Prince & Me", when I should have explored the similar results that had a similar name and were made in 2004. In the third trial, I could not find clear information about Alan Dean Foster's profession, which was key to answering the question.New Plan: To mitigate these failures, I will adopt a more systematic and thorough approach to information gathering. For each question:1. Identify all the key entities or concepts mentioned in the question.2. Perform a broad search on each of these entities to get an overview of the relevant information.3. Analyze the search results to identify any gaps or missing pieces of information needed to answer the question.4. Perform more targeted searches to fill those information gaps.5. Only once

Question: Are both Lygodium or Maxillaria a genus of orchids?
Thought 1: Search[Lygodium]
Action 1: Search[Lygodium]
Observation 1: Lygodium (climbing fern) is a genus of about 40 species of ferns, native to tropical regions across the world, with a few temperate species in eastern Asia and eastern North America. It is the sole genus in the family Lygodiaceae  in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Alternatively, the genus may be placed as the only genus in the subfamily Lygodioideae of a more broadly defined family Schizaeaceae, the family placement used in Plants of the World Online as of November 2019. Per recent molecular evidence, Lygodiaceae is thought to have diverged relatively early from the other members of the Schizaeales due to the relatively high level of synonymous sequence divergence between the families within the Schizaeales.

Action 2: Search[Maxillaria]
Observation 2: Maxillaria, abbreviated as Max in the horticultural trade, is a large genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae). This is a diverse genus, with very different morphological forms. Their characteristics can vary widely.They are commonly called spider orchids, flame orchids or tiger orchids. Their scientific name is derived from the Latin word maxilla, meaning jawbone, reflecting on the column and the base of the lip of some species, that may evoke a protruding jaw.

Under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, a new monarch succeeds automatically (demise of the Crown). The proclamation confirms by name the identity of the new monarch, expresses loyalty to the "lawful and rightful Liege Lord", and formally announces the new monarch's regnal name, while the council witnesses the signing and sealing of several documents concerning the accession. The privy council (a subset of the accession council) is then called into the presence of the monarch to hear the monarch's address and the witness monarch's signing and sealing of documents. An Accession Council has confirmed every English (and later, British) monarch since James I in 1603.

Observation 1: Sleepless in Seattle is a 1993 American romantic comedy film directed by Nora Ephron, from a screenplay written by Jeff Arch, David S. Ward and Ephron. Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the film follows a journalist (Ryan) who becomes enamored with a widowed architect (Hanks) when his son calls in to a talk radio program requesting a new wife for his grieving father. In addition to Bill Pullman, Ross Malinger, and Rob Reiner, the film also features Rosie O'Donnell, Gaby Hoffmann, Victor Garber, Rita Wilson, Barbara Garrick, and Carey Lowell.Inspired by director Leo McCarey's An Affair to Remember (1957), which was a same-script remake of McCarey's Love Affair (1939), Sleepless in Seattle was conceived as a romantic drama by Jeff Arch in 1989. Several studios rejected his script, deterred by the idea that its main couple does not meet for nearly the entire film. Ward and Ephron were hired for script revisions, with Ephron tapped to direct. Although both Hanks and Ryan had been favored for the lead roles from the beginning, several other actors expressed interest in both parts. The film was shot mostly in Seattle during the summer of 1992. Several of its most pivotal scenes were filmed on a former naval base due to the city's lack of sound stages, including a recreation of the Empire State Building's observation deck when the New York skyscraper was not available.Sleepless in Seattle was released on June 25, 1993, to positive reviews, receiving praise for Ephron's writing and direction, as well as Hanks and Ryan's performances. The film received 2 nominations at the 66th Academy Awards: Best Original Screenplay and Best Original Song. Despite competition from several blockbusters released around that same summer, the film was a surprise commercial success, earning $17 million during its opening weekend (the highest opening for a romantic comedy at the time), and ultimately grossing over $227.9 million worldwide. It was one of the highest-grossing films of 1993, and remains one of the most successful romantic comedies in box-office history. Its success extended to the home video market: it was the top rental of 1994 in the United States. The soundtrack was also successful, peaking at number one on the Billboard 200.Several critics and media publications agree that Sleepless in Seattle is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time. The film is also credited with establishing Ephron as a celebrated romantic comedy filmmaker.

Observation 2: (Result 2/2) === Casting ===Ephron promised Foster that her revised screenplay would be deserving of actors Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the latter being the actress Ephron had in mind for the character Annie. While Arch had also written the female role for Ryan due to her performance in When Harry Met Sally, he had envisioned Kevin Costner in the role of Sam. A different pair of actors had originally been envisioned in the lead roles, but departed because they were deemed not funny enough for Ephron's material. Several actresses pursued the role of Annie once they learned of Ephron's involvement, including Julia Roberts, Kim Basinger, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sharon Stone, Jodie Foster, Demi Moore and Madonna, but Ephron was determined to cast Ryan, having enjoyed working with her on When Harry Met Sally... Ryan initially expected to star in the film with her then-husband Dennis Quaid, who had been looking for a film to star in together. The couple had also been close friends with Medavoy at the time. However, Ephron felt Quaid was not funny enough to play Sam, a role she and the studio decided was more suitable for Hanks. Having grown weary of playing goofy, immature characters by this point in his career, Hanks initially turned down the role because he was unhappy with its original script, but was drawn towards Ephron's revisions because he felt her version of Sam was more serious than previous roles he had played. Despite her interest in Hanks, Ephron was not entirely convinced the actor could play a romantic leading man in the vein of Cary Grant until she met him for the first time. Hanks and Ryan had previously starred as a couple in the film Joe Versus the Volcano (1990). Despite being the film's romantic leads, the co-stars share only two scenes together, approximately two minutes of screen time.Bill Pullman originally assumed he would have a larger role in the film as Annie's fiancé Walter, since Sleepless in Seattle had been pitched to him as a love triangle similar to The Philadelphia Story (1940), envisioning himself as the James Stewart character to Hanks's Cary Grant and Ryan's Katharine Hepburn. Nathan Watt was originally cast as Sam's son Jonah, but after working together for a few days, Hanks found the child actor to be disruptive on set while trying to film scenes he was not involved in. Watt was ultimately replaced with Ross Malinger, an actor Ephron remembered from earlier auditions, although Ephron did not like some aspects of his appearance. Jason Schwartzman had also auditioned for the role. Comedian Rosie O'Donnell was cast as Becky, Annie's best friend and coworker. O'Donnell had made her film debut in A League of Their Own (1992) the previous year, appearing alongside both Hanks and Pullman. O'Donnell credits Ephron's son Jacob Bernstein with helping her secure the role, as he was a fan of her friend Madonna, with whom the comedian had also starred in A League of Their Own. Inspired by Whoopie Goldberg's Academy Award-winning performance in Ghost (1990), Ephron felt hiring a comedian in a funny supporting role would similarly benefit Sleepless in Seattle. O'Donnell based her performance on singer and actress Bette Midler, specifically emulating the way she walks and talks in order to convey "the funny, caustic best friend with a heart of gold" role she had wanted to play since deciding to become an actor. Eventually reduced from two-pages, the speech was the longest of O'Donnell's career at that point. She noted her experience was particularly different from A League of Their Own, which had been largely improvisational compared to Ephron's organized directorial style. O'Donnell and Ephron lived in the same apartment building while filming Sleepless in Seattle, which Ephron had obtained for her. Hanks' wife Rita Wilson originally auditioned for the role of Becky, but Ephron preferred her for the role of Sam's sister Suzy, which the director found particularly convenient because Wilson was already in Seattle with her husband. Ephron cast Rob Reiner, who directed When Harry Met Sally..., as Sam's friend in the film, with Reiner contributing to many of the film's laughs.According to some of the main cast, Ephron typically insisted that the actors recite their lines almost exactly as-written, although Ephron herself said she was open to the cast improvising and re-writing dialogue they felt was unfunny. Hanks and Victor Garber improvised the scene in which their characters feign tears while recounting the film The Dirty Dozen (1967), mocking Suzy who has been brought to tears by summarizing the plot of An Affair to Remember. Hanks and Ephron agreed that his character was underwritten. Ephron invited the actor to help rewrite his character, which ultimately resulted in "a grumpier, funnier Sam". Hanks did not truly commit to the role until he, Ephron and Delia reviewed his character scene by scene, ultimately improving his part. Hanks and Ephron sometimes disagreed over his character's actions, with Hanks accusing the director of making Sam too "wimpy" by writing him from a woman's perspective. He also complained that better lines had been written for his character's son, and lobbied for Sam and Jonah's relationship to be more paternal than maternal. In the original screenplay, Sam decides not to spend a weekend away with his new girlfriend Victoria in fear of upsetting Jonah. Hanks found this unconvincing for a grown man, suggesting to Ephron that, despite his son's feelings, his character would most likely be absolutely determined to sleep with Victoria after having been single for several years by that point. Ephron re-wrote the scene so Sam only relents once he learns Jonah has taken a plane to New York.  Hanks believes the film's drama ultimately benefited from being rooted in logic and "true, human behaviour". Arch explained that, despite some resistance from the actor, Hanks ultimately "rode that boundary, between being a man and having feelings he's able to express", which was rare for a male character during the 1990s. Ephron described Hanks as "manly in a part that requires him to be tender -and a lot of other things", calling him "one of the few actors around ... who can do tender and irritable and angry all at the same time". She credits Hanks with teaching her that writers should always provide the main actor with something to play off of, so they are never passive or idle during a scene.Ephron had envisioned the role of Clarisse, Jonah's babysitter, as a Shelley Duvall-type role. They ultimately cast Amanda Maher in the role, a waitress they had discovered at the Gravity Bar in Seattle, citing her as a natural. Ephron herself voices "Disappointed In Denver", a depressed character who calls into the radio show Annie is listening to in the middle of the night. Actress Parker Posey was cast in a minor role that was ultimately cut from the film. The director wrote Posey an apologetic letter assuring her that the removal from the film was not her own fault. Ephron eventually cast her in a larger role in the romantic comedy You've Got Mail (1998), also starring Hanks and Ryan. Foster appears as an extra in the restaurant scene, during which Sam and Victoria attend their first date. Hanks accused Foster of being too loud during the scene.

Prior to running, Clinton served as the United States secretary of state in the administration of Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013, a U.S. senator representing New York from 2001 to 2009, and the first lady of the United States, as the wife of Bill Clinton, from 1993 to 2001. She was defeated in the general election by the Republican candidate, businessman Donald Trump.Clinton announced her candidacy on April 12, 2015. Her main competitor in the Democratic primaries was Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran as a more progressive candidate in the primary. Clinton became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party on June 6, 2016, having received the required number of delegates. On July 22, she announced Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate, and the two were formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 26.Clinton received the most support from middle aged and older voters, as well as from African-American, Latino, and older female voters. She focused her platform on several issues, including expanding racial, LGBTQ, and women's rights; raising wages and ensuring equal pay for women; and improving healthcare. Clinton lost the general election to Republican Donald Trump on November 9, 2016; she conceded the following day. Clinton's narrow, unprecedented losses in the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin were considered key to her defeat. These states all had swings from voters who had previously voted for Obama yet went for Trump in 2016. These states have largely rely on manufacturing and part Trump’s campaign appeal was that he would end international trade agreements that hurt American manufacturing. He was outspoken on trade issues.[1]  Had Clinton been elected, she would have been the first female and first spouse of a president to serve as president of the United States, whereas her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, would also have been the first acting first lady since Margaret Woodrow Wilson.

Observation 1: W. H. Shipman House is a historic home used by William Herbert Shipman.  It is located at 141 Kaʻiulani Street, named for Princess Kaʻiulani, the last crown princess of the Kingdom and Liliʻuokalani's niece.In 1856 King Kamehameha IV leased an area known as Kolo iki to William Reed for cattle pasture. In 1861 Reed purchased the 26 acres (11 ha) and it came to be known as "Reed's Island". It is not really an island, but the area between a current and ancient channel of the Wailuku River.J. R. "Jack" Wilson owned Volcano Stables, a horse rental business at the current site of the historic Volcano Block Building in Hilo. In 1899 after an iron bridge was completed, Wilson bought a 8-acre (3.2 ha) lot with a view on Reed's island and built a large house in the Victorian architecture style. It was designed by Honolulu architect Henry Livingston Kerr, and constructed with indoor plumbing and electricity. In addition to the main house placed prominently on a hill the estate includes a guest house, servants' quarters, gardens, and a garage. An unusual feature is the two-story round tower with conical roof, circular veranda, and large curved panes of glass.In February 1901 William Shipman bought the house to entertain guests in the growing city of Hilo.Deposed Queen Liliʻuokalani would play her compositions at the grand piano when she was visiting.Author Jack London and his wife stayed at this house for five weeks in August and September 1907, while his boat The Snark was being repaired. London's book The Cruise of the Snark (1911) is based on this journey. In the early 1930s, Cecil B. DeMille filmed Four Frightened People in the gulch below the house, as well as on the Shipman land in Puna. In 1939 artist Georgia O'Keeffe stayed and was shown various sites that appeared in her paintings.The Hilo house was listed on the state register of historic places on December 5, 1973, as site 10-35-7405, and the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on June 23, 1978, as site 78001013.Barbara-Ann Andersen (daughter of Roy Shipman Blackshear, a great-granddaughter of W. H. Shipman) restored the house and operated it for roughly 20 years starting in 1997 as a bed and breakfast hotel.

Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trial was that I was unable to find the specific information needed to answer the question. I searched for general information about Operation Cold Comfort and special forces units, but did not find the key detail about the year the special forces unit involved in that operation was founded.New Plan: To answer this question, I will need to take a more targeted approach:1. Search for more details on Operation Cold Comfort, specifically trying to identify the special forces unit that carried it out.2. Once I have identified the special forces unit, I will search for information on when that unit was founded.3. With that information, I should be able to provide a final answer to the question.The key will be focusing my searches on finding the specific details needed to answer the question, rather than just general information about the topic.

Action 2: Search[Special Air Service]
Observation 2: The Special Air Service (SAS) is a special forces unit of the British Army. It was founded as a regiment in 1941 by David Stirling, and in 1950 it was reconstituted as a corps. The unit specialises in a number of roles including counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, direct action and special reconnaissance. Much of the information about the SAS is highly classified, and the unit is not commented on by either the British government or the Ministry of Defence due to the secrecy and sensitivity of its operations.The corps consists of the 22 Special Air Service Regiment, which is the regular component, as well as the 21 Special Air Service Regiment (Artists) (Reserve) and the 23 Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve), which are reserve units, all under the operational command of United Kingdom Special Forces (UKSF). Its sister unit is the Royal Navy's Special Boat Service, which specialises in maritime counter-terrorism. Both units are under the operational control of the Director Special Forces.The Special Air Service traces its origins to 1941 during the Second World War. It was reformed as part of the Territorial Army in 1947, named the 21st Special Air Service Regiment (Artists Rifles). The 22nd Special Air Service Regiment, which is part of the regular army, gained fame and recognition worldwide after its televised rescue of all but two of the hostages held during the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege.

Thought 2: Search[League of Nations]
Action 2: Search[League of Nations]
Observation 2: The League of Nations (LN or LoN; French: Société des Nations [sɔsjete de nɑsjɔ̃], SdN) was the first worldwide intergovernmental organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. It was founded on 10 January 1920 by the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War. The main organisation ceased operations on 18 April 1946 when many of its components were relocated into the new United Nations (UN) which was created in the aftermath of the Second World War.The League's primary goals were stated in its eponymous Covenant. They included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Its other concerns included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe. The Covenant of the League of Nations was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, and it became effective with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920. Australia was granted the right to participate as an autonomous member nation, marking the start of Australian independence on the global stage. The first meeting of the Council of the League took place on 16 January 1920, and the first meeting of the Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920. In 1919, U.S. president Woodrow Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role as the leading architect of the League. Despite this, he was ultimately unsuccessful in getting his country to join it.The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious Allied Powers of World War I (Britain, France, Italy and Japan were the initial permanent members of the Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement medical tents, Benito Mussolini responded that "the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out."At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. After some notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. Its credibility was weakened because the United States never joined. Japan and Germany left in 1933, Italy left in 1937, and Spain left in 1939. The Soviet Union only joined in 1934 and was expelled in 1939 after invading Finland. Furthermore, the League demonstrated an irresolute approach to sanction enforcement for fear it might only spark further conflict, further decreasing its credibility. One example of this hesitancy was the Abyssinia Crisis, in which Italy's sanctions were only limited from the outset (coal and oil were not restricted), and later altogether abandoned despite Italy being declared the aggressors in the conflict. The onset of the Second World War in 1939 showed that the League had failed its primary purpose: to prevent another world war. It was largely inactive until its abolition. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations effectively replaced it in 1945, inheriting several agencies and organisations founded by the League, with the League itself formally dissolving the following year.Current scholarly consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its main goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, gave a voice to smaller nations; fostered economic stabilisation and financial stability, especially in Central Europe in the 1920s; helped to raise awareness of problems such as epidemics, slavery, child labour, colonial tyranny, refugee crises and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation. Professor David Kennedy portrays the League as a unique moment when international affairs were "institutionalised", as opposed to the pre–First World War methods of law and politics.

Question: Otterington railway station was on a 393 mi major railway that linked Edinburgh to what city?
Thought 1: Search[Otterington railway station]
Action 1: Search[Otterington railway station]
Observation 1: Otterington railway station was located in the village of South Otterington, North Yorkshire, on the East Coast Main Line. It opened in 1841 and closed in 1958. The station is now a private residence, though the platform can still be seen. The buildings date from the 1930s when the East Coast Main Line was widened.The station became a listed building in 2018.
Thought 2: Search[East Coast Main Line]
Action 2: Search[East Coast Main Line]
Observation 2: The East Coast Main Line (ECML) is a 393-mile-long (632 km) electrified railway between its northern terminus at Edinburgh Waverley and southern terminus at London King's Cross.  Peterborough, Doncaster, York, Darlington, Durham and Newcastle are on the line, which is a key transport artery on the eastern side of Great Britain running broadly parallel to the A1 road. The main line acts as a 'spine' for several diverging branches, serving destinations such as Cambridge, Leeds, Hull, Sunderland and Lincoln, all with direct services to London. In addition, a few ECML services extend beyond Edinburgh to serve other Scottish destinations, such as Stirling, Inverness, Dundee, or Aberdeen.The line was built during the 1840s by three railway companies, the North British Railway, the North Eastern Railway, and the Great Northern Railway. In 1923, the Railways Act 1921 led to their amalgamation to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the line became its primary route. The LNER competed with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) for long-distance passenger traffic between London and Scotland. The LNER's chief mechanical engineer Nigel Gresley designed iconic Pacific steam locomotives including Flying Scotsman and Mallard, the latter of which achieved a world record speed for a steam locomotive, 126 mph (203 km/h) on the Grantham-to-Peterborough section on 3 July 1938.In 1948, the railways were nationalised and operated by British Railways. In the early 1960s, steam was replaced by diesel-electric traction, including the Deltics, and sections of the line were upgraded so that trains could run at speeds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h). With the demand for higher speed, British Rail introduced InterCity 125 high-speed trains between 1976 and 1981. In 1973, a Class 41 (an HST prototype) achieved a top speed of 143 mph (230 km/h) in a test run. In the 1980s, the line was electrified and InterCity 225 trains introduced. These have in turn been largely replaced by Class 800 and Class 801 units. The November 2021 Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands stated that the linespeed would be upgraded to 140 mph (225 km/h).The line links London, South East England, East Anglia and the East Midlands, with Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland, and is important to their local economies. It carries commuter traffic in north London as well as cross-country, commuter and local passenger services, and freight. In 1997, operations were privatised. The primary long-distance operator is London North Eastern Railway, but open-access competition on services to Northern England and Scotland is provided by Hull Trains, Grand Central and Lumo.
Thought 3: Based on the information provided, the Otterington railway station was located on the East Coast Main Line, which is a 393-mile railway line that links Edinburgh to London King's Cross. Therefore, the city that the East Coast Main Line linked Edinburgh to is London.

The follow-up, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), earned the same accolades. X&Y (2005) concluded what Coldplay viewed as a trilogy, and its successor, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), secured a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album; both releases topped the charts in over 30 countries, becoming the best-sellers of their respective years worldwide. Viva la Vida's title track was the first song by a British act to reach number one in the United States and United Kingdom simultaneously in the 21st century.The albums Mylo Xyloto (2011), Ghost Stories (2014), A Head Full of Dreams (2015), Everyday Life (2019), Music of the Spheres (2021) and Moon Music (2024) drew from genres such as electronica, R&B, ambient, disco, funk, gospel, blues and progressive rock.

Thought 2: Search[Patti Page]
Action 2: Search[Patti Page]
Observation 2: Clara Ann Fowler (November 8, 1927 – January 1, 2013), better known by her stage name Patti Page, was an American singer. Primarily known for pop and country music, she was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six-decade-long career. She was often introduced as "the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page". New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as "A Page in my life called Patti".Page signed with Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948's "Confess". In 1950, she had her first million-selling single "With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming", and eventually had 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965.Page's signature song, "Tennessee Waltz", is the best selling song of the 1950s by a female artist, one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is recognized today as one of the official songs of the state of Tennessee. It spent 13 weeks atop the Billboard's best-sellers list in 1950/51. Page had three additional number-one hit singles between 1950 and 1953, "All My Love (Bolero)", "I Went to Your Wedding", and "(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?".Unlike most other pop singers, Page blended country music styles into many of her songs. As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page's singles appeared on the Billboard Country Chart. In the 1970s, she shifted her style more toward country music and began having even more success on the country charts, ending up as one of the few vocalists to have charted in five separate decades.With the rise of rock and roll in the 1950s, mainstream popular music record sales began to decline. Page was among the few pop singers who were able to maintain popularity, continuing to have hits well into the 1960s, with "Old Cape Cod", "Allegheny Moon", "A Poor Man's Roses (or a Rich Man's Gold)", and "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte".In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. She was posthumously honored with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2013.

Observation 1: Velvetpark: Dyke Culture in Bloom is a lesbian and feminist arts and culture American website that regularly features music, literature, theater, fine arts, film, television, and social activism as it impacts queer culture. Velvetpark also hosts a social network and dating community for lesbians and queer-identified women.
Thought 2: Search[Shape magazine]
Action 2: Search[Shape magazine]
Observation 2: Shape (stylized in all caps) is an American monthly fitness magazine started by Weider Publications in 1981, founded by Christine MacIntyre (a pioneer in women's free weight fitness) and became the number one women's fitness magazine. At that time, Weider Enterprises consisted primarily of the bodybuilding magazine Muscle & Fitness. Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present Shape, Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine. Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy. MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided. Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1987. Weider was purchased by American Media in 2002. A German version of Shape is available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The magazine is also edited in Romania.Elizabeth Goodman Artis was named Editor-in-Chief in 2014 and held the position until 2021.On January 28, 2015, it was reported that Shape would be acquired by Meredith Corp. and Fitness, published by the company, would cease publication in May 2015 and be combined with it.
Thought 3: Finish[Velvetpark]Based on the information gathered:- Velvetpark is described as a "lesbian and feminist arts and culture American website" that "regularly features music, literature, theater, fine arts, film, television, and social activism as it impacts queer culture." It also hosts a social network and dating community for lesbians and queer-identified women.- Shape magazine, while a fitness magazine targeted at women, does not seem to be specifically focused on a lesbian or queer-identified female readership. The magazine was founded with the goal of presenting a "healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy."Therefore, the evidence suggests that Velvetpark is written more for a lesbian and queer-identified female readership compared to Shape magazine.

Observation 2: The New York and New Jersey campaign in 1776 and the winter months of 1777 was a series of American Revolutionary War battles for control of the Port of New York and the state of New Jersey, fought between British forces under General Sir William Howe and the Continental Army under General George Washington.  Howe was successful in driving Washington out of New York, but overextended his reach into New Jersey, and ended the New York and New Jersey campaign in January 1777 with only a few outposts near New York City under British control. The British held New York Harbor for the rest of the Revolutionary War, using it as a base for expeditions against other targets.Landing unopposed on Staten Island on July 3, 1776, Howe had assembled an army that included components that had withdrawn from Boston in March following the British failure to hold that city, combined with additional British troops, and Hessian troops hired from several German principalities. Washington's Continental Army included New England soldiers and regiments from the Thirteen Colonies as far south as the Colony of Virginia. Landing on Long Island in August, Howe defeated Washington in the largest battle of the war in North America, but the Continental Army was able to regroup and make an orderly and covert retreat to Manhattan that night under a cover of darkness and fog. Washington suffered a series of further defeats in Manhattan but prevailed in a skirmish at the Battle of Harlem Heights and eventually withdrew his troops successfully to White Plains, New York. Howe, meanwhile, returned to Manhattan and captured those forces Washington had left on the island.Washington and much of his army crossed the Hudson River to Rockland County and then south into New Jersey, retreated across the state, and then crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. Along the way, his army shrank due to the ending of enlistment periods, desertions, and poor morale. Howe ordered his troops into winter quarters in December, establishing a chain of outposts from New York City to Burlington, New Jersey.  Washington, in a tremendous boost to American morale, launched a successful strike against the Trenton garrison on the morning of December 26, 1776, prompting Howe to withdraw his chain of outposts back to New Brunswick and the coast near New York. Washington, in turn, established his winter camp at Morristown.  During the following winter months and through the rest of the war, both sides skirmished frequently around New York City and New Jersey as the British sought forage and provisions.Britain maintained control of New York City and some of the surrounding territory until the war ended in 1783, using it as a base for operations elsewhere in North America.  In 1777, General Howe launched a campaign to capture the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia, leaving General Sir Henry Clinton in command of the New York area, while General John Burgoyne led an attempt to gain control of the Hudson River valley, moving south from Quebec and being defeated at Saratoga.

Incorporating themes from multiple genres, including dark fantasy, science fantasy, horror, and Western, it describes a "gunslinger" and his quest toward a tower, the nature of which is both physical and metaphorical. The series, and its use of the Dark Tower, expands upon Stephen King's multiverse and in doing so, links together many of his other novels.In addition to the eight novels of the series proper that comprise 4,250 pages, many of King's other books relate to the story, introducing concepts and characters that come into play as the series progresses.The series was chiefly inspired by the poem "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came" by Robert Browning, the full text of which was included in the final volume's appendix. In the preface to the revised 2003 edition of The Gunslinger, King also identifies The Lord of the Rings, Arthurian legend, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as inspirations. He identifies Clint Eastwood's "Man with No Name" character as one of the major inspirations for the protagonist, Roland Deschain. King's style of location names in the series, such as Mid-World, and his development of a unique language (High Speech), are also influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien's work.A film based on Stephen King's novel series was released in August 2017.

Observation 5: Marvel's Netflix television series are a set of interconnected American television series created for the streaming service Netflix, based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. Produced by Marvel Television and ABC Studios, they are set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the franchise's films and other television series. Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb revealed the group of shows were known internally as the "Marvel Street-Level Heroes" or "Marvel Knights" series.A deal between Marvel and Netflix to produce several interconnected series was announced in November 2013, with the individual series Daredevil (2015–2018), Jessica Jones (2015–2019), Luke Cage (2016–2018), and Iron Fist (2017–2018) culminating in the crossover miniseries The Defenders (2017). A spin-off from Daredevil, The Punisher (2017–2019), was ordered in April 2016. The series were all filmed in New York State, forming the state's largest television production commitment across 161 episodes. They star Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones, Mike Colter as Luke Cage, and Finn Jones as Danny Rand / Iron Fist, who all star together in The Defenders, as well as Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher. Many actors have roles across the different series, including Rosario Dawson who signed a special deal to portray Claire Temple.The series are believed to have generated strong viewership for Netflix, who do not release exact viewership details, and received positive reviews for their casts and darker take on the MCU. There were some common criticisms of the series, such as for their pacing. Netflix had cancelled all of the series by February 2019, when Marvel's parent company Disney was preparing its own streaming service, Disney+. The series were all removed from Netflix on March 1, 2022, after Disney regained the licenses for them, and they began streaming on Disney+ from March 16, where they were collected under the title "The Defenders Saga".Contractually, Marvel had to wait two years before they could use the characters without Netflix. Vincent D'Onofrio and Cox were the first actors to reprise their roles in Marvel Studios-produced MCU projects, in December 2021. A new Daredevil series, titled Daredevil: Born Again, premiered in 2025 on Disney+, with Cox, D'Onofrio, Bernthal, other Daredevil cast members, and Ritter returning, while a Punisher-centered Marvel Studios Special Presentation television special starring Bernthal is in development.

- I apologize for the incorrect answer in the previous trial. Let me diagnose the possible reason for the failure and devise a new, concise, high-level plan to mitigate the same failure.Possible reason for failure:In the previous trial, I was able to find information about the Oneida Community, which was a religious Utopian group. However, I did not find the connection that this group later became the giant silverware company Oneida Limited, which was run by Pierrepont Noyes. I focused too much on the Oneida Community itself and did not make the necessary link to the silverware company.New plan:1. Search for information on the Oneida Community and its connection to the silverware company.2. Specifically look for information on Pierrepont Noyes and his role in running the silverware company.3. Synthesize the information to provide a concise answer to the original question.

Action 1: Search[Oneida Community]
Observation 1: The Oneida Community ( oh-NYE-də) was a perfectionist religious communal society founded by John Humphrey Noyes and his followers in 1848 near Oneida, New York. The community believed that Jesus had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about Jesus's millennial kingdom themselves, and be perfect and free of sin in this world, not just in Heaven (a belief called perfectionism). The Oneida Community practiced communalism (in the sense of communal property and possessions), group marriage, male sexual continence, Oneida stirpiculture (a form of eugenics), and mutual criticism.The community's original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878. There were smaller Noyesian communities in Wallingford, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; Putney and Cambridge, Vermont. The branches were closed in 1854 except for the Wallingford branch, which operated until the 1878 tornado devastated it.The Oneida Community dissolved in 1881, converting itself to a joint-stock company. This eventually became the silverware company Oneida Limited, one of the largest in the world.

Question: Where was the first governor after the The Missouri Compromise from?
Thought 1: Search[Missouri Compromise]
Action 1: Search[Missouri Compromise]
Observation 1: The Missouri Compromise (also known as the Compromise of 1820) was federal legislation of the United States that balanced the desires of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it. It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.Earlier, in February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Democratic-Republican (Jeffersonian Republican) from New York, had submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood that included restrictions on slavery. While the slave states earlier claimed Federal protection for slavery, they now objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery and claimed that it was a state issue, as settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana Purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a state's slave population.Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. "[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality." "The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states."When free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine's admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise provision that banned slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half of the anti-restrictionist Southerners in the House to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso and maneuvered a number of restrictionist northerners in the House to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. While the Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, with the House sustaining its northern anti-slavery position and the Senate blocking a state that restricted slavery, it succeeded in the 16th Congress.The Missouri Compromise was controversial.  While it mollified most people at the time and settled the issue for more than 20 years, many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along regional and sectarian lines.  Tensions resumed in the 1840s and the Compromise of 1850 only briefly defused the situation. The Kansas–Nebraska Act effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), both of which increased tensions over slavery and contributed to the American Civil War. The compromise both delayed the Civil War and sowed its seeds; at that time, Thomas Jefferson predicted the line as drawn would someday tear the Union apart. Forty years later, the North and South would split closely along the 36°30′ parallel and launch the Civil War.

Observation 2: Engelbert Dollfuss (alternatively Dollfuß; 4 October 1892 – 25 July 1934) was an Austrian politician and dictator who served as chancellor of Austria between 1932 and 1934. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative and nationalist government. This crisis culminated in the self-elimination of the Austrian Parliament, a coup sparked by the resignation of the presiding officers of the National Council. Suppressing the Socialist movement in the Austrian Civil War and later banning the Austrian Nazi Party, he cemented his rule through the First of May Constitution in 1934. Later that year, Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitler's Anschluss in 1938.

In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific 2004 film "The Prince and Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, but could not locate the director information. In the third trial, I was unable to find the specific Shakespeare tragedy that had a character named Benvolio, as well as the protagonist who secretly loved and married a member of the rival house.New Plan: To mitigate these failures, I will adopt a more systematic and thorough approach to searching for information. Rather than jumping straight to trying to answer the question, I will first focus on gathering all the relevant details and information needed to fully understand the context of the question. This will involve:1. Carefully reading the question to identify all the key entities, events, and relationships that need to be researched.2.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find the specific information needed to answer the questions. In the first trial, I should have searched for each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols, rather than just one, in order to gather more complete information about their fates. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the exact title of the 2004 film, when I should have tried searching for similar film titles from that year instead. And in the third trial, I was unable to identify the specific Shakespeare tragedy being referenced, which prevented me from answering the subsequent details about the protagonist and their secret love interest.New Plan: To avoid similar failures in the future, I will adopt a more systematic and thorough approach to information gathering. When presented with a question, I will:1. Identify all the key entities, events, or concepts mentioned in the question.2. Conduct targeted searches for each of those elements, gathering as much relevant information as possible.3.

Question: This expansion of the 2008 magazine article "Is Google Making Us Stoopid?" was a finalist for what award?
Thought 1: Search[Is Google Making Us Stoopid?]
Action 1: Search[Is Google Making Us Stoopid?]
Observation 1: Is Google Making Us Stupid? What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains! (alternatively Is Google Making Us Stoopid?) is a magazine article by technology writer Nicholas G. Carr, and is highly critical of the Internet's effect on cognition. It was published in the July/August 2008 edition of The Atlantic magazine as a six-page cover story. Carr's main argument is that the Internet might have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation. Despite the title, the article is not specifically targeted at Google, but more at the cognitive impact of the Internet and World Wide Web. Carr expanded his argument in The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains, a book published by W. W. Norton in June 2010.The essay was extensively discussed in the media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.While long-term psychological and neurological studies have yet to yield definitive results justifying Carr's argument, a few studies have provided glimpses into the changing cognitive habits of Internet users. A UCLA study led some to wonder whether a breadth of brain activity—which was shown to occur while users performed Internet searches in the study's functional MRI scans—actually facilitated reading and cognition or possibly overburdened the mind; and what quality of thought could be determined by the additional presence of brain activity in regions known to control decision-making and complex reasoning skills.
Thought 2: The information provided does not mention anything about the expanded version of the 2008 magazine article "Is Google Making Us Stoopid?" being a finalist for an award. The passage focuses on providing background information on the original article and the subsequent book "The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains", but does not discuss any awards or recognition received by the expanded work. Without any details about an award the expanded article was a finalist for, I do not have enough information to answer the question.
Action 2: Finish[I do not have enough information to determine what award the expansion of the 2008 magazine article "Is Google Making Us Stoopid?" was a finalist for.]

- Diagnosis: The previous trials indicate that I was unable to find the specific information needed to answer the questions. In the first trial, I focused on searching for details about one of the prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols, but did not thoroughly search for information about the other two prime ministers and how they were assassinated. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific 2004 film that Kam Heskin appeared in, but could not locate the exact title. In the third trial, I was able to find background information on The Chronicle of Philanthropy and Antic, but did not have the details needed to determine the overlap in their publishing years.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will take a more systematic approach to searching for and synthesizing the relevant information needed to answer the questions. Specifically:1. For the first trial, I will search for each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols, and look for information on how they were assassinated and in what context. I will then try to piece together the connections between the three prime ministers and their assassinations.2. For the second trial, I will start by searching for

I searched for information about The Chronicle of Philanthropy and Antic separately, but did not find any direct information about the overlap in their publishing timelines.New Plan:1. Search for more information on The Chronicle of Philanthropy, including when it was founded and how long it has been published.2. Search for information on Antic, including when it was published.3. Look for any mentions of the two publications overlapping in time or being published concurrently.4. If I can find the years when both publications were active, I can determine if there was any overlap in their publishing timelines.5. Provide a final answer based on the information gathered.

Search for more detailed information on the founding and publishing dates of Antic.3. Compare the timelines of the two publications to see if there was any period where they were published concurrently.4. Provide the answer based on the information found in the search results.By focusing the search on finding the specific publication dates for each magazine, I should be able to uncover the information needed to determine if and when their publishing overlapped. This more targeted approach should allow me to provide a definitive answer to the original question.

Question: This term about a playwright who lived from 1564-1616 presented what about his works? 
Thought 1: Search[William Shakespeare]
Action 1: Search[William Shakespeare]
Observation 1: William Shakespeare (c. 23 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" or simply "the Bard". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner ("sharer") of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men after the ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 (around 1613) he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and even certain fringe theories as to whether the works attributed to him were written by others.Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in English. In the last phase of his life he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) such as The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, and collaborated with other playwrights.Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623 John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its preface includes a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, who hailed Shakespeare with the now-famous epithet: "not of an age, but for all time".

Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The previous trial failed because I was unable to find the specific movie where Stephanie Kay Panabaker and her elder sister Danielle Nicole Panabaker acted together. I searched for information on each of the sisters individually, but did not find any clear indication of them appearing in the same film.New Plan: To answer this question, I will need to search for more information on the acting careers and filmographies of the Panabaker sisters. I should look for any movies or TV shows where they were both credited as cast members. This will require a more targeted search to try to find the specific movie mentioned in the question.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trial was the inability to find the specific information needed to answer the question. The searches for the Panabaker sisters' filmographies and the movie they appeared in together did not yield the necessary details.New Plan:1. Search for information on the Panabaker sisters, Stephanie Kay Panabaker and Danielle Nicole Panabaker, to get an overview of their acting careers and any movies they may have appeared in together.2. Carefully review the search results to identify any movies or projects where the two sisters were cast together.3. If a specific movie is found where they co-starred, provide the name of that movie as the final answer.4. If no definitive information can be found about a movie featuring both sisters, acknowledge the lack of sufficient information to answer the question confidently.
- Diagnosis: The previous trial failed because I was unable to find the specific movie where Stephanie Kay Panabaker and her elder sister Danielle Nicole Panabaker acted together. The search results provided details on their individual acting careers, but did not mention any projects they co-starred in.New Plan: To answer this question, I will need to take a more targeted approach. Instead of just searching for the individual actresses, I should search for information on movies or projects where the Panabaker sisters appeared together. This will likely require searching for the sisters' filmographies or looking for articles that specifically mention their co-starring roles.
- Diagnosis: The previous trials indicate that I was unable to find the specific information needed to answer the questions. In the first trial, I focused on searching for details about one of the prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols, but did not thoroughly search for information on the other two prime ministers and how they were assassinated. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the exact title of the 2004 film, rather than searching for more general information about the film franchise or the actors involved. In the third trial, I was unable to find any information about the Panabaker sisters appearing in a movie together.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will take a more systematic approach to searching for information. Rather than jumping straight to searching for specific details, I will first try to gather broader context about the topic. This could involve searching for overviews or summaries of the relevant events, people, or films. Once I have a better understanding of the general context, I can then narrow my searches to find the specific information needed to answer the question. Additionally, if I am unable to find the exact information requested, I will try to provide the most relevant information I can find,

- Diagnosis: The previous trial failed because I was unable to find information about a "famous bavagheet" by Arun Date. I searched for information about Arun Date, but did not find any specific details about a famous "bavagheet" (which appears to be a misspelling of "bhavageete", a type of Marathi song). Without being able to find the specific information requested in the question, I was unable to provide the correct answer.New Plan: To answer this question, I will:1. Search for information on "bhavageete" to understand what it is and its significance in Marathi music.2. Search for information on Arun Date's contributions to bhavageete, and try to identify any famous or well-known bhavageete songs/compositions by him.3. Synthesize the information found to provide a concise answer to the original question.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find the specific information requested in the questions. In the first trial, I was able to find information about the Rome Protocols and the Prime Ministers involved, but I did not fully connect the dots to determine that one of the Prime Ministers (Engelbert Dollfuss) was assassinated as part of World War II. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific 2004 film "The Prince & Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, but could not locate the director information. In the third trial, I was unable to find any details about a "famous bavagheet" (likely referring to "bhavageete") composed by Arun Date.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will focus on the following:1.

Search for more information on the "bhavageete" genre and its key composers/singers.2. Specifically search for information on Arun Date's contributions and any of his famous or notable bhavageete compositions.3. If I can find details on a specific "famous bavagheet" by Arun Date, provide that as the final answer.4.

Observation 1: Bhaavageete or Bhavageeth (literally 'emotion poetry') is a form of poetry and pop music in India. Most of the poetry sung in this genre pertains to subjects like love, nature, and philosophy, and the genre itself is not much different from ghazals, though ghazals are bound to a peculiar metre. This genre is quite popular in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. This genre may be called by different names in other languages. In Telugu, they are known as Bhava Geethaalu.

This would have allowed me to identify the one who was assassinated as part of World War II.2. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to search for the exact title "The Prince & Me (2004 film)", when I should have tried searching for similar titles or the broader "The Prince and Me" franchise.

- Apologies, I was unable to determine the subsidiary of the record company that released "Love Incredible" based on the information provided in the previous trial. A few potential reasons for the failure:1. Lack of information about the record company that released "Love Incredible" - the initial search for "Love Incredible" provided details about the song itself, but did not mention the record company or any subsidiaries.2. Insufficient search strategy - I should have tried to find more information about the record company behind the song, such as searching for "record company Love Incredible" or "label Love Incredible" after the initial song search.3. Inability to connect the dots - Even if I had found information about the record company, I may have struggled to identify the specific subsidiary that released the song.To improve, my new plan would be:1. Perform a more targeted search for information about the record company behind "Love Incredible", such as "record label Love Incredible" or "who released Love Incredible".2. Once I identify the main record company, search for information on any subsidiaries or imprints that may have been involved in the song's release

I searched for the song "Love Incredible" and found that it was released by Interscope Records, but I did not find any information about a subsidiary record company called "Mad Love" that may have been involved in the release.New Plan: To answer this question, I will take the following steps:1. Search for more information on the record label "Mad Love" to determine if it is a subsidiary or related to Interscope Records in any way.2. If I can find a connection between Mad Love and Interscope Records, I will provide the name of the subsidiary as the final answer.3. If I cannot find a clear connection between the two record labels, I will acknowledge that I do not have enough information to confidently answer the question.

Question: What is the subsidiary of the record company who released "Love Incredible?"
Thought 1: Search[Love Incredible]
Action 1: Search[Love Incredible]
Observation 1: "Love Incredible" is a song by Norwegian DJ and producer Cashmere Cat, featuring American singer Camila Cabello. It is Cabello's first solo single since leaving the girl group Fifth Harmony. The electropop and R&B-pop song was released on February 17, 2017, through Interscope Records and Mad Love as the third single from Cashmere Cat's debut studio album, 9 (2017).
Thought 2: Search[Mad Love record label]
Action 2: Search[Mad Love record label]
Observation 2: Could not find [Mad Love record label]. Similar: ['Mad Love (Linda Ronstadt album)', 'Mad Love (EP)', 'Mad Love (JoJo album)', 'List of Universal Music Group labels', 'A&M Records', '4AD', 'Big Beat Records (American record label)', 'List of record labels: I–Q', 'Mad Head Love', 'Divine Mad Love']
Thought 3: Search[Interscope Records subsidiaries]
Action 3: Search[Interscope Records subsidiaries]
Observation 3: Interscope Records is an American record label based in Santa Monica, California, owned by Universal Music Group through its Interscope Geffen A&M imprint. Founded in late 1990 by Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field as a $20 million joint venture with Atlantic Records of Warner Music Group and Interscope Communications, it differed from most record labels by letting A&R staff control decisions and allowing artists and producers full creative control. Interscope's first hit records arrived in under a year, and it achieved profitability in 1993. Chair and CEO until May 2014, Iovine was succeeded by John Janick.In 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive rights to market and distribute releases from hardcore hip hop label Death Row Records, a decision that ultimately put the label at the center of the mid-1990s gangsta rap controversy. As a result, Time Warner, then the parent of Warner Music Group, severed ties with Interscope by selling its 50 percent stake back to Field and Iovine for $115 million in 1995. In 1996, 50% of the label was acquired for a reported $200 million by MCA Inc., later known as Universal Music Group.
Thought 4: Based on the information provided, it appears that the subsidiary of the record company that released "Love Incredible" is Mad Love. The song was released through both Interscope Records and Mad Love, and Interscope Records is the main record label owned by Universal Music Group. However, the search results did not clearly state that Mad Love is a subsidiary of Interscope Records. To be more confident in the answer, I would need to find more explicit confirmation of the relationship between Mad Love and Interscope Records.
Action 4: Finish[Mad Love]

- Apologies, the previous attempt was unsuccessful. Let me diagnose the issue and devise a new plan.The main issue was that I did not thoroughly search for all the relevant information to answer the question. I started by searching for general information about the "Beer Wars" documentary, but I did not find the specific brewery mentioned in the question. I then searched for Stone Brewing Co., which is located in Escondido, California, but I did not confirm that it was featured in the "Beer Wars" documentary.To improve, I will take a more systematic approach:1. Search for information about the "Beer Wars" documentary to understand the key topics and breweries covered.2.

Question: Beer Wars covers the differences between large corporate breweries, and small breweries, such as what brewery that is headquartered in Escondido, california?
Thought 1: Search[Beer Wars documentary]
Action 1: Search[Beer Wars documentary]
Observation 1: Beer Wars is a 2009 documentary film about the American beer industry. In particular, it covers the differences between large corporate breweries, namely Anheuser-Busch, the Miller Brewing Company, and the Coors Brewing Company opposed to smaller breweries like Dogfish Head Brewery, Moonshot 69, Yuengling, Stone Brewing Co., and other producers of craft beer. Also covered is how advertising and lobbyists are used to control the beer market, implying that these things harm competition and consumer choice.Throughout the film, there is a theme that the smallest breweries have next to no chance to compete due to the sheer volume of advertising and outdated beer distribution laws. The original laws demanded a three-tier system to separate the powers of selling beer. The law demands that the beer brewer cannot deliver directly to the retailer, supposedly creating a separation of powers resembling the US government's legislative, judicial, and executive branches. The film claims these laws are now inhibiting growth of smaller brewers and therefore allowing the largest brewers (Coors, Anheuser-Busch, and Miller) to maintain an oligopoly on beer.The film was written, produced, narrated, and directed by Anat Baron, former head of Mike's Hard Lemonade.
Thought 2: Search[Stone Brewing Co.]
Action 2: Search[Stone Brewing Co.]
Observation 2: Stone Brewing (formerly Stone Brewing Co.) is a brewery headquartered in Escondido, California, United States. Founded in 1996 in San Marcos, it is the largest brewery in Southern California. Based on 2020 sales volume, it is the ninth largest craft brewery in the United States.The brewery's first beer was Stone Pale Ale, which was considered to be its flagship ale until it was retired in 2015. The company's best known brand is Arrogant Bastard Ale, which has been described as a "watershed beer" that "put San Diego on the craft brew map." Most of Stone's beers are characteristic of west-coast craft beer, meaning that they have a high hop content, and an average alcohol strength between 6% and 10%.Stone Brewing has been rated as a "world class brewery" by two beer enthusiast websites, RateBeer and BeerAdvocate. Stone Brewing has been voted by the readers of Beer Advocate as the #1 "All Time Top Brewery on Planet Earth."In August 2022, Sapporo Breweries bought Stone for $165 million, with the Stone brewery taking on production of Sapporo beers in California for distribution across North America.

Observation 2: Joe Frazier vs. Muhammad Ali, billed as The Fight of the Century or simply The Fight, was an undisputed heavyweight championship boxing match between WBA, WBC, and The Ring heavyweight champion Joe Frazier and Lineal champion  Muhammad Ali, on Monday, March 8, 1971, at Madison Square Garden in New York City.The fight is widely regarded as the biggest boxing match in history and arguably the single most anticipated and publicized sporting event of all time. An international audience observed the spectacle. It was the first time that two undefeated boxers who held or had held the world heavyweight title fought each other for that very title.The bout held broad appeal for many Americans, including non-boxing and non-sport fans. Ali, who had been stripped of his titles by boxing authorities for refusing to submit to the draft for the Vietnam War, had become a symbol of the anti-establishment public during his government-imposed exile from the ring. In contrast, Frazier supported U.S. involvement in the war, and he had been adopted by elements of the public with alternate views. In addition, both men possessed intense personal animosity towards each other.Frazier won in fifteen rounds by unanimous decision. Ali dealt with his first professional loss. It became the first of a trio of fights, followed by the rematch events Super Fight II (1974) and the Thrilla in Manila (1975). Both of those fights were won by Ali.

Observation 2: In the United Kingdom, the Accession Council is a ceremonial body which assembles in St James's Palace in London  upon the death of a monarch to make formal proclamation of the accession of the successor to the throne. Under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, a new monarch succeeds automatically (demise of the Crown). The proclamation confirms by name the identity of the new monarch, expresses loyalty to the "lawful and rightful Liege Lord", and formally announces the new monarch's regnal name, while the council witnesses the signing and sealing of several documents concerning the accession. The privy council (a subset of the accession council) is then called into the presence of the monarch to hear the monarch's address and the witness monarch's signing and sealing of documents. An Accession Council has confirmed every English (and later, British) monarch since James I in 1603.

The searches revealed that Duke Energy is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Affiliated Managers Group is headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida, with additional offices in Massachusetts and other locations. However, the question specifically asked if both companies are based in Massachusetts, which could not be conclusively determined from the available information.New plan:
- Diagnosis: The previous trial failed because I was unable to conclusively determine whether both Duke Energy and Affiliated Managers Group are based in Massachusetts based on the information provided. The search results indicated that Duke Energy is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Affiliated Managers Group is headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida, with additional offices in Massachusetts and other locations. However, the information did not clearly state whether both companies are based in Massachusetts.New Plan: To answer this question more effectively, I will:1. Search for the headquarters locations of both Duke Energy and Affiliated Managers Group to confirm their primary locations.2. Lookup any additional information about whether either company has significant operations or is considered to be based in Massachusetts.3. Synthesize the information to determine if both companies are based in Massachusetts or not.By taking a more thorough and systematic approach to gathering the relevant information, I can avoid making an unsupported guess and provide a more reliable answer.

- Diagnosis: The previous trial failed because I was unable to find the specific information needed to answer the question. I searched for the artist Janne Kyttanen and found information about his background and work, but I did not find any information about his work being exhibited at a modern art museum in Amsterdam.New Plan: To answer this question, I will take a more systematic approach:1. Search for "Janne Kyttanen" to get background information on the artist.2. Lookup the keywords "Janne Kyttanen" and "modern art museum" to see if I can find any mentions of his work being exhibited at a museum in Amsterdam.3. If I still cannot find the specific museum, I will search for "modern art museums in Amsterdam" and cross-reference that with information about Janne Kyttanen's exhibitions.By taking this more comprehensive approach, I hope to be able to identify the specific modern art museum in Amsterdam where Janne Kyttanen's work has been exhibited.

Look for any mentions of a 2004 film she starred in, and try to find the title of that specific film.3. Once I have the film title, search for information on the director of that 2004 film.4. Provide the final answer based on the information gathered.The key steps here are to be more thorough in searching for the specific film details, rather than just the actor's name. By focusing on finding the 2004 film title first, I can then use that information to search for the director, which should lead to the correct answer.

You have attempted to answer following question before and failed. The following reflection(s) give a plan to avoid failing to answer the question in the same way you did previously. Use them to improve your strategy of correctly answering the given question.
Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The failure in the previous trial was due to not being able to find the specific information needed to answer the question. The search results did not contain the details about the baseball player's birth year, rookie year, and team that were specified in the question.New Plan: To answer this type of question, I will need to:1. Search for the name of the baseball player mentioned in the question.2. Carefully review the search results to find the player's birth year, rookie year, and team information.3. If I can find all the details specified in the question, I will provide the answer. 4. If I cannot find all the details, I will indicate that I am unable to determine the answer from the available information.The key is to thoroughly search for and extract the specific details required to answer the question, rather than making assumptions or guesses. By following this more systematic approach, I can improve my chances of successfully answering this type of question.
- Possible reason for failure: The search results did not provide the specific information needed to answer the question. The searches for "professional baseball player born in 1984 played as a rookie for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2007" and "Los Angeles Dodgers 2007 rookie" returned general information about the 2007 Dodgers season, but did not mention any players matching the details provided in the question.New plan:1. Search for "Los Angeles Dodgers 2007 roster" to get a list of players on the team that year.
- Diagnosis: The previous reasoning trial failed because I was unable to find the relevant information to answer the question. The search results I obtained were not related to the question being asked, as they were about the 2025 Los Angeles Dodgers season rather than a player who debuted in 2007. I did not have enough information to determine the answer.New Plan: To answer this question, I will need to search for information specifically about Los Angeles Dodgers players who debuted in 2007. I will search for terms like "Los Angeles Dodgers 2007 rookies" or "Los Angeles Dodgers 2007 roster" to try to find a list of players who joined the team that year. Then I will look for any players born in 1984 and see if I can find their name and confirm they were a rookie in 2007.
- Diagnosis: The previous reasoning trial failed because I was unable to find the relevant information to answer the question. I searched for the 2007 Los Angeles Dodgers roster, but the results were about a future season in 2025 which was not helpful. I should have tried different search queries to find information specifically about Los Angeles Dodgers players who debuted in 2007.New Plan:

Observation 2: The 2025 Los Angeles Dodgers season was the 136th season for the Los Angeles Dodgers franchise in Major League Baseball (MLB), their 68th season in Los Angeles, California, and their 64th season playing their home games at Dodger Stadium. They entered the season as the defending World Series champions after winning their eighth World Series title in franchise history, and finished the season by successfully defending their title for the first time in franchise history, winning their ninth title in the 2025 World Series over the Toronto Blue Jays, 4–3.For the second year in a row, the Dodgers began the season outside of America, this time in Tokyo, Japan for the Tokyo Series. They became the first defending World Series champion to begin their season 8–0, besting the previous record held by the 1933 Yankees, who started their season 7–0. The Dodgers clinched their 13th straight post-season appearance on September 19, extending the longest streak in franchise history. On September 25, they clinched the National League West title for the fourth straight season and 12th time the last 13 years.On September 18, 3-time Cy Young winner and former MVP Clayton Kershaw announced his retirement at the conclusion of the season. The team passed 4 million in home attendance for the first time in franchise history.As the third seed, the Dodgers opened the playoffs in the Wild Card Series against the sixth seed, Cincinnati Reds. They swept the Reds in two games to advance to the NLDS. They then defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in four games and advanced to the National League Championship Series for the second year in a row. They swept the Milwaukee Brewers in four games to win their second straight NLCS and the fifth in nine years (2017–2018, 2020, 2024–2025), in a series defined by their starting pitching dominance. They defeated the Blue Jays in the World Series in seven games to become the first franchise to repeat as World Series champions since the 1998–2000 New York Yankees. The Dodgers were just the ninth team to win Games 6 and 7 on the road in a World Series. In Game 7, they were the first team in MLB history to stage a comeback on the road in the ninth inning of a winner-take-all World Series game, ultimately winning in 11 innings by a score of 5-4. Unlike last season, the Dodgers did not hold home-advantage for any of the last three rounds.
Thought 3: I apologize, but I am unable to determine the answer to this question based on the information available. The search results I obtained did not contain any details about a Los Angeles Dodgers player born in 1984 who debuted as a rookie in 2007. The results were about future Dodgers seasons rather than the 2007 season specifically. Without being able to find the relevant player details, I cannot provide a confident answer to this question. I would need to search for more specific information about Dodgers players from the 2007 season in order to try to identify the player matching the details provided.

Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trial was the inability to find the specific information needed to answer the question. The searches conducted did not provide the necessary details about Maroon 5's discography and the lead vocalist for each of their studio albums.New Plan:1. Search for "Maroon 5 discography" to get an overview of their studio album releases.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find the specific information needed to answer the questions. In the first trial, I should have searched for more details on each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols, rather than just focusing on one. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the exact title of the 2004 film, when I should have tried searching for more general information about the film franchise. In the third trial, I was unable to find Maroon 5's full discography, which prevented me from determining the lead vocalist for their sixth studio album.New Plan: To mitigate these types of failures in the future, I will adopt a more systematic and comprehensive approach to information gathering. Rather than relying on a single search or piece of information, I will:1. Perform a broader initial search to get an overview of the topic, then gradually narrow down to more specific details.2. Cross-reference multiple reliable sources to corroborate and fill in any gaps in the information.3.

Instead of searching for general information about Maroon 5's discography, I would try to find details on each of their studio albums, including the release dates, track listings, and information about the lead vocalists. This would involve searching for something like "Maroon 5 sixth studio album" or "Maroon 5 album releases" to try to find the specific information needed to answer the question.Additionally, I would try to find a reliable source that provides comprehensive information about Maroon 5's discography, such as an official band website or a reputable music database.

His apparent success led to Roman invasion, nominally in support of his defeated enemies. He resisted the Romans for almost a decade, using guerrilla warfare, but when he offered a set-piece battle he was defeated by Roman forces. After defeat he fled to the territory of Queen Cartimandua, who captured him and handed him over to the Romans.

Observation 1: Sleepless in Seattle is a 1993 American romantic comedy film directed by Nora Ephron, from a screenplay written by Jeff Arch, David S. Ward and Ephron. Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the film follows a journalist (Ryan) who becomes enamored with a widowed architect (Hanks) when his son calls in to a talk radio program requesting a new wife for his grieving father. In addition to Bill Pullman, Ross Malinger, and Rob Reiner, the film also features Rosie O'Donnell, Gaby Hoffmann, Victor Garber, Rita Wilson, Barbara Garrick, and Carey Lowell.Inspired by director Leo McCarey's An Affair to Remember (1957), which was a same-script remake of McCarey's Love Affair (1939), Sleepless in Seattle was conceived as a romantic drama by Jeff Arch in 1989. Several studios rejected his script, deterred by the idea that its main couple does not meet for nearly the entire film. Ward and Ephron were hired for script revisions, with Ephron tapped to direct. Although both Hanks and Ryan had been favored for the lead roles from the beginning, several other actors expressed interest in both parts. The film was shot mostly in Seattle during the summer of 1992. Several of its most pivotal scenes were filmed on a former naval base due to the city's lack of sound stages, including a recreation of the Empire State Building's observation deck when the New York skyscraper was not available.Sleepless in Seattle was released on June 25, 1993, to positive reviews, receiving praise for Ephron's writing and direction, as well as Hanks and Ryan's performances. The film received 2 nominations at the 66th Academy Awards: Best Original Screenplay and Best Original Song. Despite competition from several blockbusters released around that same summer, the film was a surprise commercial success, earning $17 million during its opening weekend (the highest opening for a romantic comedy at the time), and ultimately grossing over $227.9 million worldwide. It was one of the highest-grossing films of 1993, and remains one of the most successful romantic comedies in box-office history. Its success extended to the home video market: it was the top rental of 1994 in the United States. The soundtrack was also successful, peaking at number one on the Billboard 200.Several critics and media publications agree that Sleepless in Seattle is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time. The film is also credited with establishing Ephron as a celebrated romantic comedy filmmaker.

By taking this more methodical approach, I can improve my chances of successfully answering the question.
- Possible reasons for failure:1. The search queries were too broad and generic, making it difficult to find the specific information needed to answer the question. The details provided were quite specific, and I was unable to find a clear match through the broad searches.2. I did not have enough context or clarification about the individuals involved - the American cartoonist, writer, producer, animator, and voice actor, as well as the multiple award-nominated and winning comic book creator they worked with. Without more details, I could not confidently determine the answer.New plan:1. Request more specific details about the individuals involved, such as their names, the titles of the works they collaborated on, or any other identifying information.2. Break down the search query into more targeted, specific searches to try to find the relevant information. For example, search for the names of the individuals, the titles of their collaborative works, or the awards they have won.3.

Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The previous reasoning trial failed because I was unable to find the specific information needed to answer the question about the creature of American folklore that gained notoriety in 1964. I searched for general information about creatures of American folklore, but did not find any details about a specific creature that gained notoriety in 1964.New Plan: To answer this question, I will:1. Search for information on the Loch Ness Monster, as it is a well-known creature of folklore that gained notoriety in the 1960s, to see if that is the correct answer.2. If the Loch Ness Monster is not the correct answer, I will search for information on other famous American folklore creatures, such as Bigfoot or the Jersey Devil, and try to find any details about them gaining notoriety in 1964 specifically.3. If I still cannot find the correct answer, I will try to find a more comprehensive list of American folklore creatures and their histories to see if I can identify the specific one referenced in the question.
- Diagnosis: The previous attempts failed because I was unable to find the specific creature of American folklore that gained notoriety in 1964. I searched for general American folklore creatures like the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, and the Jersey Devil, but none of those matched the criteria given in the question.New Plan:1. Search for a list of famous American folklore creatures to see if any gained notoriety in 1964.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find the specific information needed to answer the questions. In the first trial, I should have searched for each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols and looked up details on their deaths, rather than just focusing on Mussolini. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the exact title of the 2004 film, when I should have tried searching for similar film titles or the actors/characters involved. In the third trial, I was unable to find any information about a specific American folklore creature that gained notoriety in 1964, likely because the question was too broad and I did not have enough context to narrow down the search.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will take a more systematic approach to information gathering and try to gather as much relevant context as possible before attempting to answer the question. Specifically:1. For the first trial, I will search for each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols, look up details on their deaths, and then synthesize that information to determine how they were assassinated as part of a larger event.2
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of specific information about the key entities involved in the questions. In the first trial, I was able to find information about the Rome Protocols and the Prime Ministers involved, but I did not thoroughly search for details on how one of the Prime Ministers was assassinated. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific 2004 film "The Prince and Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, without success. In the third trial, I was unable to find any information about a specific "creature of American folklore" that gained notoriety in 1964, likely due to the vagueness of the question.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will take a more systematic and thorough approach to searching for key information when answering these types of questions:1. Identify all the main entities mentioned in the question (e.g. names, titles, events, etc.).2. Perform a broad search on each of these entities to get an overview of the relevant context and details.3. Based on the initial search results, identify any gaps in my understanding or missing

Thought 4: I apologize, I do not have enough information to definitively answer the question about what creature of American folklore gained notoriety in 1964. The searches I have performed so far have not yielded any clear results about a specific creature matching those criteria. To try to find the answer, I would need to do more comprehensive searches on American folklore creatures and their histories to see if any gained significant attention or notoriety in 1964 specifically. Without more context or clues in the original question, I am unable to confidently identify the creature being referenced. I do not want to guess the answer, as that could lead to providing incorrect information. The best I can do is acknowledge the limitations of my current knowledge and suggest further research to try to uncover the specific creature in question. Please let me know if you have any other details that could help me narrow down the search.

In the third trial, I was unable to find the specific video game where Alice David voiced Lara Croft, as the search results did not provide that level of detail.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will take a more systematic and thorough approach to searching for information. Rather than jumping straight to trying to find the final answer, I will break down the questions into smaller, more manageable steps and search for the key pieces of information needed to answer each step. This may involve searching for background information, identifying relevant entities or keywords, and then drilling down to find the specific details required. I will also be more open to using a combination of search results to piece

Thought 5: I apologize, but I do not have enough information to definitively answer which company developed the video game where Alice David voiced the character of Lara Croft. The search results indicate that Alice David has voiced Lara Croft in the French dub of the Tomb Raider video game series, but they do not specify which particular game or which company developed that game. To answer this question, I would need to find more details on the specific Tomb Raider game where Alice David provided the French voice for Lara Croft, and the company that developed that game. Without that level of specificity, I cannot provide a complete answer. Please let me know if you have any other information that could help me narrow down the details needed to answer this question.

You have attempted to answer following question before and failed. The following reflection(s) give a plan to avoid failing to answer the question in the same way you did previously. Use them to improve your strategy of correctly answering the given question.
Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of specific information about the key entities involved (the German project, the duo from Silverdale, England, and the song they collaborated on). The searches were too broad and did not yield the necessary details to answer the question.New Plan:1. Search for information on German music projects or bands from the early 2000s timeframe, as the question suggests this is a relatively recent event.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of specific information about the key entities involved in the question. Without the names of the German project, the duo from Silverdale, England, and the song they collaborated on, I was unable to find the necessary details to answer the question.New Plan:1. Search for the name of the German project that recorded a song featuring vocals by a duo from Silverdale, England.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of specific and targeted searches. Instead of making broad searches, I should have broken down the question into more specific components and searched for each of them individually. This would have allowed me to gather more relevant information and piece together the answer step-by-step.New Plan:1. Search for information on the "German project" that recorded the song. This will help identify the specific musical group or artist involved.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of specific information to narrow down the search and find the relevant details needed to answer the questions. Without key details like the names of the entities involved (German project, duo from Silverdale, England, song title), it was difficult to perform targeted searches that could uncover the necessary information.New Plan:1. Search for more context about the question, such as the time period, genre of music, or any other clues that could help identify the specific German project and duo.2. If additional context is provided, use that to perform more targeted searches, such as searching for "German electronic music projects 2000s" or "music duo from Silverdale, England".3. Scan the search results carefully to look for any mentions of a German project collaborating with a duo from Silverdale, England on a song. Pay close attention to details like song titles, artist names, and release dates.4. If the key details are found, synthesize the information to provide a concise final answer using the Finish[answer] format.5. If after several targeted searches, the necessary information is

Observation 2: German electronic music is a broad musical genre encompassing specific styles such as electroclash, trance, krautrock and schranz. It is widely considered to have emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, becoming increasingly popular in subsequent decades. Originally minimalistic style of electronic music developed into psychedelic and prog rock aspects, techno and electronic dance music. Notable artists include Kraftwerk, Can, Tangerine Dream and Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft. German electronic music contributed to a global transition of electronic music from underground art to an international phenomenon, with festivals such as Love Parade, Winterworld and MayDay gaining prominence alongside raves and clubs.
Thought 3: I do not have enough information to definitively answer the question "Which German project recorded a song that featured vocals by a duo from Silverdale, England?". The search results so far provide some background on German electronic music projects, but do not mention any specific collaborations between a German project and a duo from Silverdale, England. To answer this question, I would need more targeted information, such as:- The name of the specific German music project or artist- The title of the song they recorded featuring the duo from Silverdale- Confirmation that the duo was from Silverdale, EnglandWithout these key details, I cannot confidently identify the German project and song in question. I would need to perform more focused searches to try to uncover this information. If I am unable to find the relevant details after several attempts, the best I can do is acknowledge that I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer.

- Apologies, I was unable to determine the occupations that both Ian Hunter and Rob Thomas share based on the information provided. The key issue was that the search results did not directly state the occupations of both individuals, only providing biographical details. To answer this question, I would need to find information that explicitly states the occupations they have in common. A better approach would be to search for information comparing the occupations of Ian Hunter and Rob Thomas, rather than just searching for their individual biographies. This would allow me to directly identify the overlapping occupations between the two. In the future, I will focus on finding information that directly compares the relevant attributes between the entities in the question, rather than just searching for individual profiles.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the inability to find the relevant information to answer the questions. The search queries were too broad or specific, and the search results did not provide the necessary details to determine the occupations of Ian Hunter and Rob Thomas.New Plan:1. Search for "Ian Hunter" and "Rob Thomas" separately to gather basic information about each individual, such as their professions and backgrounds.
- Diagnosis: The previous trial failed because I was unable to find the specific 2004 film that Kam Heskin played Paige Morgan in, and therefore could not determine the director of that film. I got stuck in a loop searching for the film title without success.New Plan: To answer this question, I will take a more systematic approach:1. Search for information on Kam Heskin to confirm she played the role of Paige Morgan.2. Search for information on the "The Prince and Me" film franchise to try to identify the specific 2004 film.3. If I can find the 2004 film, I will search for information on the director of that film.4. If I am still unable to determine the director, I will try searching for other films Kam Heskin has appeared in around 2004 to see if I can find the relevant information.By taking this more structured approach and not jumping to a final answer too quickly, I hope to be able to successfully identify the director of the 2004 film that Kam Heskin played Paige Morgan in.

Reflections:
- The previous trial was unsuccessful because the information provided was about William Howard Taft, the 27th president of the United States, rather than the William Howard associated with a railroad that the question was asking about. To mitigate this failure, I would devise the following new plan:1. Search for "William Howard railroad" to try to find information specifically about the William Howard in question and the railroad he worked for.2. If that search does not yield relevant results, I would try searching for "William Howard" and see if any information about a different William Howard associated with a railroad comes up.3. If I still cannot find the relevant information, I would try searching for the context of the original question, such as the time period or location, to see if that provides any clues about which William Howard and railroad the question is referring to.4. If I am still unable to determine the answer from the available information, I would acknowledge that I do not have enough information to answer the question and provide a Finish[Unable to determine] response.The key is to focus the search specifically on the person and railroad mentioned in the question, rather than making assumptions about which William Howard is being referre
- The previous trial was unsuccessful because the information provided was about William Howard Taft, the 27th president of the United States, rather than the William Howard associated with a railroad. To answer this question, I would need to find information specifically about a William Howard who worked for a railroad, rather than the president William Howard Taft.A new, concise, high-level plan to mitigate this failure would be:1. Search for "William Howard railroad" to try to find information about a William Howard associated with a railroad, rather than the president.2. If the search results do not contain the relevant information, try searching for more specific details about the railroad William Howard worked for.3. If I still cannot find the information needed to answer the question, I will acknowledge that I do not have enough information to determine the original line of the railroad that William Howard worked for.By focusing the search on finding information about the specific William Howard associated with a railroad, rather than the president, I can avoid the mistake of providing irrelevant information and better address the original question.
- The previous trial was unsuccessful because the information provided was not relevant to answering the question about where the original line of the railroad that William Howard worked for was located. The passage was about William Howard Taft, the 27th president of the United States, and did not contain any information about a William Howard associated with a railroad.To mitigate this failure, a new plan would be to:1. Search for information specifically about a "William Howard" who was involved with a railroad, rather than the president William Howard Taft.2. Look for details on the original line of the railroad that this William Howard worked for.3. Provide the answer based on the information found in the search results.The key is to focus the search on the specific details required to answer the question, rather than getting sidetracked by irrelevant information. By honing in on the relevant "William Howard" and his railroad involvement, I should be able to find the necessary information to provide a complete answer.
- Diagnosis: The previous trial failed because the search results did not contain the relevant information needed to answer the question. The search for "William Howard railroad" returned information about President William Howard Taft, which was not relevant to the question asked.New Plan:

Question: Where was the original line of the railroad William Howard worked for?
Thought 1: Search[William Howard railroad]
Action 1: Search[William Howard railroad]
Observation 1: William Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 – March 8, 1930) was the 27th president of the United States from 1909 to 1913 and the tenth chief justice of the United States from 1921 to 1930. He is the only person to have held both offices.Taft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. His father, Alphonso Taft, was a U.S. attorney general and secretary of war. Taft attended Yale and joined Skull and Bones, of which his father was a founding member. After becoming a lawyer, Taft was appointed a judge while still in his twenties. He continued a rapid rise, being named solicitor general and a judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1901, President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and he became Roosevelt's hand-picked successor. Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice, Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, believing his political work to be more important.With Roosevelt's help, Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency in that November's election. As president, he focused on East Asia more than European affairs and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments. Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs, then a major source of governmental income, but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests. His administration was filled with conflict between the Republican Party's conservative wing, with which Taft often sympathized, and its progressive wing, toward which Roosevelt moved more and more. Controversies over conservation and antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men. The 1912 presidential election was a three-way race, as Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination. Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates and Roosevelt bolted the party. The split left Taft with little chance of reelection, and he took only Utah and Vermont in his loss to Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson.After leaving office, Taft returned to Yale as a professor, continuing his political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft chief justice, an office he had long sought. Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues, and under him there were advances in individual rights. In poor health, he resigned in February 1930, and died the following month. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there. Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.
Thought 2: The search results do not contain any information about a William Howard associated with a railroad. The information provided is about President William Howard Taft, which is not relevant to answering the original question. To answer this question, I would need to find information specifically about a William Howard who worked for a railroad, rather than the president. Since I do not have the necessary information, I cannot determine the original line of the railroad that William Howard worked for.

You have attempted to answer following question before and failed. The following reflection(s) give a plan to avoid failing to answer the question in the same way you did previously. Use them to improve your strategy of correctly answering the given question.
Reflections:
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of specific information about the key entities involved (the Rome Protocols, the 2004 film, and the Gator Country guitarist). The searches were too broad and did not provide the necessary details to answer the questions.New Plan:1. For the Rome Protocols question:   - Search for each of the three Prime Ministers (Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula Gömbös) individually to find details about their assassinations and how they were related to the Rome Protocols.   - Synthesize the information from the individual searches to determine what the Prime Ministers were assassinated as part of.2. For the Kam Heskin/Paige Morgan question:   - Search for the specific 2004 film "The Prince & Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, and find the director of that film.   - If the film title is not found, try searching for similar film titles or franchises that Kam Heskin was involved in to find the relevant 2004 film.3
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trials was the lack of specific information about the key details in the questions. In the first trial, I should have searched for each of the three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols and looked up details about their deaths, rather than just focusing on Mussolini. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific 2004 film "The Prince & Me" that Kam Heskin starred in, instead of looking for similar films or franchises that may have been relevant. In the third trial, the question about a Gator Country guitarist co-writing a song called "Bloody Reunion" did not have enough contextual information for me to determine the relevant band.New Plan: To improve my performance, I will focus on the following:1. Ask clarifying questions: If a question does not provide enough specific details, I will ask the user for additional context or information that could help me better understand the key elements of the question.2. Conduct more comprehensive searches: Instead of just searching for one or two key terms, I will try to search for multiple related entities, events, or details
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trial was that the information provided in the search results did not contain the specific details needed to answer the question. The search results mentioned a Southern rock band called Gator Country and a South Korean horror film called "Bloody Reunion", but there was no connection between the two or any information about a Gator Country guitarist co-writing a song called "Bloody Reunion".New Plan: To answer this question, I will need to find more specific information about the Gator Country guitarist who co-wrote a song called "Bloody Reunion". I will start by searching for "Gator Country band members" to try to identify the guitarist in question. Then I will search for information on that guitarist's musical background and previous bands they may have been a part of. Finally, I will search for information on the song "Bloody Reunion" and its co-writers to see if I can find a connection to the Gator Country guitarist.
- Possible reason for failure: The key information needed to answer the question was not provided in the search results. The question asked about a Gator Country guitarist who co-wrote a song called "Bloody Reunion", but the search results did not mention any such song or guitarist. Without this specific information, I was unable to determine the answer.New plan:1. Search for more details about the Gator Country band, including its members and any songs they may have co-written.2. If I can find information about a "Bloody Reunion" song and a Gator Country guitarist who co-wrote it, I will search for that guitarist's previous band.3. If I cannot find the specific details about the "Bloody Reunion" song and the Gator Country guitarist, I will acknowledge that I do not have enough information to answer the question.

Question: What band did Gator Country guitarist that co-wrote Bloody Reunion come from?
Thought 1: Search[Gator Country band]
Action 1: Search[Gator Country band]
Observation 1: Gator Country was an American Southern rock band formed in Davie, Florida, in 2005 by several ex-members of the Southern rock group Molly Hatchet.  The band, founded by vocalist Jimmy Farrar, guitarist Duane Roland, drummer Bruce Crump, guitarist Steve Holland, and bassist Riff West took its name from the title of the hit song, "Gator Country".In 2006, Gator Country, led by vocalist Jimmy Farrar, continued to perform popular songs such as "Beatin' The Odds", "Bounty Hunter" as well as "Oh Atlanta".

However, I was not able to find the specific details about the type of character featured in the third book and last novel. To improve, I should have continued searching for more information on the later books in the series to try to determine the type of character featured, rather than just stating what I could not find.

Observation 2: Mary Poppins is a series of eight children's books written by Australian-British writer P. L. Travers and published over the period 1934 to 1988. Mary Shepard was the illustrator throughout the series. The series began with Mary Poppins in 1934.The books centre on the magical English nanny Mary Poppins, who is blown by the East wind to Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, London, and into the Banks household to care for their children. Encounters with pavement-painters and shopkeepers, and various adventures ensue, until Mary Poppins abruptly leaves, i.e., "pops out". Only the first three of the eight books feature Mary Poppins arriving and leaving. The later five books recount previously unrecorded adventures from her original three visits. As Travers explains in her introduction to Mary Poppins in the Park, "She cannot forever arrive and depart."The books were adapted by Walt Disney into a musical film titled Mary Poppins (1964), starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. The film Saving Mr. Banks (2013) depicted the making of the 1964 film. Disney's sequel to the 1964 film, Mary Poppins Returns, was released in 2018, and stars Emily Blunt as Poppins. In 2004, Disney Theatrical in collaboration with Sir Cameron Mackintosh (who had previously acquired the stage rights from Travers) produced a stage musical also called Mary Poppins in London's West End theatre. The stage musical was transferred to Broadway, in New York, in 2006, where it ran until its closing on 3 March 2013.

Travers. The search results indicate that the later books in the series recount previously unrecorded adventures from Mary Poppins' original three visits, but do not provide specifics on the characters or themes in those later books. I would need to find more targeted information about the content and focus of the third book and final novel to determine the type of character featured. Without that level of detail, I cannot confidently provide a final answer to the question. My apologies, but I do not have the necessary information to answer this query.

The searches performed did not yield any clear results about Huntsinger working with a gospel singer born in that month.New Plan:1. Search for more information on David Huntsinger's musical collaborations, focusing specifically on gospel artists.2. Once I have a better understanding of Huntsinger's gospel collaborations, search for information on the birth months of notable gospel singers to see if any were born in July.3. Combine the information from steps 1 and 2 to try to identify a gospel singer born in July that Huntsinger has worked with.4. If I am still unable to find a definitive answer, acknowledge the lack of sufficient information to answer the question confidently.

- Possible reason for failure: The key issue here was that I was unable to find any information about Jerome Bernard, which prevented me from determining if he and Ira Lewis had a common film adaptation. Without that crucial piece of information, I could not provide a satisfactory answer to the question.New plan:1. Search for more information on Jerome Bernard to try to find any connections to film adaptations.2. If I can find information on Jerome Bernard's work, cross-reference it with the information I have about Ira Lewis and the film adaptation of "Chinese Coffee" to see if there is any overlap.3. If I can find a common film adaptation between the two, provide that as the answer. 4. If I still cannot find a connection, acknowledge that I do not have enough information to determine if they share a common film adaptation.
- Diagnosis: The main reason for the failure in the previous trial was the inability to find any information about Jerome Bernard, one of the key entities in the question. Without being able to cross-reference Jerome Bernard's work with the information about Ira Lewis, I could not determine if they had a common film adaptation.New Plan:1.

I should have tried searching for more variations of the name or related topics to see if I could find any relevant information. Without being able to locate details on Jerome Bernard, I do not have the necessary information to provide a definitive answer.To improve, I could try the following:1.

Search for film adaptations that Ira Lewis has been involved with, and then try to cross-reference those with any information I can find on Jerome Bernard.3. Broaden my search to look for any film adaptations that both individuals may have worked on, even if not directly together.4.

In the first trial, I should have searched for information on all three prime ministers involved in the Rome Protocols, not just one, in order to determine how they were assassinated. In the second trial, I got stuck in a loop trying to find the specific film title "The Prince & Me (2004 film)", when I should have tried searching for similar film titles or the film franchise more broadly. In the third trial, I was unable to find any information on Jerome Bernard, which prevented me from determining if he and Ira Lewis had a common film adaptation.New Plan: To mitigate these failures, I will adopt a more comprehensive and flexible search strategy:1. For questions requiring information on multiple entities, I will search for each relevant entity individually to gather all the necessary details before attempting to answer.2.

Reflections:
- Apologies, my previous attempt to answer the question was incorrect. Let me re-evaluate the problem and devise a new plan.Diagnosis: The key issue in my previous attempt was that I did not fully understand the context and relationship between the "chicken dance" and the original dance it is derived from. I focused too narrowly on just the chicken dance itself, without considering the broader dance style or genre it is associated with.New Plan:
- Apologies, I was unable to correctly answer the previous question about the chicken dance. Here is my diagnosis and a new plan:Diagnosis: The main reason for my failure was that I did not fully understand the relationship between the chicken dance and the polka dance. While I was able to find information about the chicken dance itself, I did not clearly establish how it relates to or is derived from the polka dance. I made an assumption that the chicken dance is a "change of pace" of the polka, but I did not have strong evidence to support that claim.New Plan: To better answer this question, I will take the following steps:1. Search for more information on the origins and history of the chicken dance, specifically looking for any connections or relationships to the polka dance.
- Diagnosis: The previous trial failed because I was unable to determine the dance that the "chicken" dance is a change of pace for. I searched for information on the "chicken" dance itself, but did not find any information linking it to a specific parent dance.New Plan: To answer this question, I will need to search for information on the "chicken" dance and try to determine what larger dance or dance style it is derived from or associated with. This will likely require searching for more context around the origins and history of the "chicken" dance to see if it is commonly performed as part of or in conjunction with another dance. Once I have identified the parent dance, I can provide a final answer.
- I apologize, but I was unable to determine the dance that the "chicken dance" is a change of pace for based on the information provided. The search results indicate that the "chicken dance" is a well-known dance in its own right, often performed at events like Oktoberfest and weddings, but do not specify what the original or primary dance style is that it is a change of pace from. Without that key piece of information, I cannot confidently provide a final answer. In the future, I will need to search more thoroughly to find the specific dance style that the "chicken dance" is derived from or associated with in order to answer this type of question.

The song was composed by accordion player Werner Thomas from Davos, Switzerland, in the 1950s.The Chicken Dance is a well-known drinking and dancing song at American Oktoberfest events. It is also a popular dance at weddings, particularly in whose culture includes polka music. Over 140 versions have been recorded worldwide, including some that were released by Walt Disney Records, together making an estimated 40,000,000 records or more pressed.

Observation 4: Folk music is a music genre that includes traditional folk music and the contemporary genre that evolved from the former during the 20th-century folk revival. Some types of folk music may be called world music. Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, music that is played on traditional instruments, music about cultural or national identity, music that changes between generations (folk process), music associated with a people's folklore, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. The term originated in the 19th century, but folk music extends beyond that.Starting in the mid-20th century, a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the (second) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. This form of music is sometimes called contemporary folk music or folk revival music to distinguish it from earlier folk forms. Smaller, similar revivals have occurred elsewhere in the world at other times, but the term folk music has typically not been applied to the new music created during those revivals. This type of folk music also includes fusion genres such as folk rock, folk metal, and others. While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, in U.S. English it shares the same name, and it often shares the same performers and venues as traditional folk music.

Observation 1: Lygodium (climbing fern) is a genus of about 40 species of ferns, native to tropical regions across the world, with a few temperate species in eastern Asia and eastern North America. It is the sole genus in the family Lygodiaceae  in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Alternatively, the genus may be placed as the only genus in the subfamily Lygodioideae of a more broadly defined family Schizaeaceae, the family placement used in Plants of the World Online as of November 2019. Per recent molecular evidence, Lygodiaceae is thought to have diverged relatively early from the other members of the Schizaeales due to the relatively high level of synonymous sequence divergence between the families within the Schizaeales.

The civilian death toll was about six to 13 million. The Triple Entente (also known as the Allies) lost about six million military personnel while the Central Powers lost about four million. At least two million died from diseases and six million went missing, presumed dead. This article lists the casualties of the belligerent powers based on official published sources.About two-thirds of military deaths in World War I were in battle, unlike the conflicts that took place in the 19th century when most deaths were from disease.  Nevertheless, disease, including the 1918 flu pandemic and deaths while held as prisoners of war, still caused about one third of total military deaths for all belligerents.

Observation 6: World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history. An estimated total of 70–85 million deaths were caused by the conflict, representing about 3% of the estimated global population of 2.3 billion in 1940. Deaths directly caused by the war (including military and civilian fatalities) are estimated at 50–56 million, with an additional estimated 19–28 million deaths from war-related disease and famine. Civilian deaths totaled 50–55 million. Military deaths from all causes totaled 21–25 million, including deaths in captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war. More than half of the total number of casualties are accounted for by the dead of the Republic of China and of the Soviet Union. The following tables give a detailed country-by-country count of human losses. Recent historical scholarship has shed new light on the topic of Second World War casualties. Research in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union has caused a revision of estimates of Soviet World War II fatalities. According to Russian government figures, USSR losses within postwar borders now stand at 26.6 million, including 8 to 9 million due to famine and disease. In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland's dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million. Historian Rüdiger Overmans of the Military History Research Office (Germany) published a study in 2000 estimating the German military dead and missing at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders, in Austria, and in east-central Europe. The Red Army claimed responsibility for the majority of Wehrmacht casualties during World War II. The People's Republic of China puts its war dead at 20 million, while the Japanese government puts its casualties due to the war at 3.1 million. An estimated 7–10 million people died in the Dutch, British, French and US colonies in South and Southeast Asia, mostly from war-related famine.
